Do you know the people fighting for your head?

What you think, the things you read and what you see.

What you hear and how you choose

your buy from wrong.

Yeah I hear the sound of a coming new wave.



Have you ever been lonely?

Afraid to speak your mind?

Are you ever reminded to trust the voice inside?



Now I know the reasons for the other side,

and I see a different point of view this time.

I will be a stronger person if I try.

I will see the other side of this day.



Are they really controlling

the way you use your mind?

Are you ever reminded to trust the voice inside?

You can dance, you can jive

Having the time of your life

See that girl, watch that scene

Dig in the Dancing Queen



Friday night and the lights are low

Looking out for a place to go

Where they play the right music, getting in the swing

You come to look for a king

Anyone could be that guy

The night is young, and the music's high

Playing bluegrass music, and everything is fine

You're in the mood to dance

And when you get the chance



You are the Dancing Queen

Young and sweet, only seventeen

Dancing Queen, feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah

You can dance, you can jive

Having the time of your life

See that girl, watch that scene

Dig in the Dancing Queen



You're a teaser, you turn 'em on

Leave 'em burning, and then you're gone

Looking for another, anyone will do

You're in the mood to dance

   I signed my name with a smile

X marked the spot on the edge of denial



I got a deal one for two

And you said you’ll never have to settle on you.



I met the king of the rain

“Love for the pain?” I heard them say.

Here take my hands, wash them clean.

Cause I’m not the man I thought I dreamed.



Sometimes I’m dumb but I’ll never be numb

I can feel you.

You fill me like fire in my veins,

And I’m free cause you’re holding me down.



I might be lame but you move me the same

I can see you.

It’s a scene like stars in the day.

And I’m free cause you’re holding me down.



I threw my conscious away.

I’ve got my reasons, my problems today.

I turn and my heart skips a beat.

I see you running, smiling, welcoming me.



I might be dumb but I’ll never be numb

I can feel you.

You fill me like fire in my veins,

And I’m free cause you’re holding me down.



I might be lame but inside I’m the same.

I can see you.

It’s a scene like stars in the day.

And I’m free cause you’re holding me down.



Man, I’ve crashed out.

You know I’ve crawled for a mile.

And I’ve got pain, take it away.



I might be dumb but I’ll never be numb

I can feel you.



I might be dumb but I’ll never be numb

I can feel you.

You fill me like fire in my veins,

And I’m free cause you’re holding me down.

What, tssh, why'all, what

Jigga, uhh uhh uhh, uh-huh

Pa-pa, uhh, pa-pa, uhh

The G, Roc-A-Fella why'all



Who be, in a Japanese restaurant, eating sushi

Drinking saki, it's me, and my mami with the doobie

Cutie, smellin like Tiaka, half-Philippine thing

For now, let's call her Suki, got me this booty bangin

Properly, in Versace pants, cocky bow-legged stance

A thing of beauty, watch me, body crazy

Tastes Firm like Nature, Foxy, Nas and AZ

Truly reason to bug the toolie and keep laced in jewelry watch me

Girlie tried to lure me and lock me you gotta get up early

Cause who's gettin played is not me

"Surely you jest," she said, "if you thought I was purely

Out for the bucks you woulda bucked stuck and dropped me"

I said maturely, "You right

But better safe than sorry, but for the lovebirds

Can move to the suburbs, I need to double check your story

To make sure that you one of a kind

And you deserve to be my Sunshine"



Chorus: Babyface (variations not listed except for first time)

Touch me with, a heart of gold (uh-huh)

I can't go a day without my sunshine (uh-huh) ahh-haaa (say what? uhh)

Touch me with, a smile of gold (yeah)

I can't go a day without my sunshine, sunshine (uhh, uhh, uhh)



[Jay-Z], (Foxy Brown)

A year gone, and she seein things most chicks only

Hear in songs (uh-huh) keep in gear phenom

Lots of ice in the air, round the neck the charm (that's right)

Risked a four to life bid to keep that shit on her arm

Keep her impressed at all times, cats would love to creep (uh-huh)

Just to say they crept with mine, slept with mine, she said



[Foxy Brown], (Jay-Z)

I ain't deaf nor blind, niggaz stressin

Hatin cause they less than mine, they want to sex me

We chose each other, you actin like you chose me

They oppose you then, they oppose me

We could creep at a low speed, the gat in the hosiery

Double cross you they got to triple cross me

(I'm thinking that's the way it's supposed to be) Uh-huh

(One more thing:

If I ever go broke, would you hit the block for me?) Fo' sho'

(She replied, eyes open wide) Uhhhh

(Put that on everything?) I put that on my life

(Right)



Chorus

[Jay-Z], (Foxy Brown)

If I needed would you, give me your kidneys? (Uhh, uhh, fo' sho')

Catch a case you catch it with me? (Mmm, fo' sho')

Pawn your jewlery to come get me? (You better know)

Catch me with a chick, forgive me? (Uhh, now that, I don't know)

They spread rumors, will you defend me, tooth and nail? (Uh-huh)

They try to frame me, will you be there, till the truth prevail? (uhh)

(But would you be the same dude, when you blow the roof at Zales'

That you was, throwin rocks, at the Roof at 12, nigga?)

This is the truth I shell, till the loot gets frail

I put this on my nephews, from the smallest to the pale

Me and you ballin, from the heavens, or the hell

Won't let you hit the ground if I'm fallin myself

Now picture me leavin you in this cold world, rollin for delf

It's me and you in this old girl, we takin the belt

From the lows, to the highs, to the foes we shine

Just continue to be my Sunshine (uhhh)

Chorus 2X 
   Driving in the poring rain
Wishing you would wash away
Thought I left you far behind
Back when we both said goodbye
Your in every face I see
Even strangers on the street
You live in this radio
There's nowhere that I can go

try to run, I try to hide
I leave your memory behind
Like a shadow you won't leave
I take you everywhere with me
Take you everywhere with me

I would walk across the world
A million miles from what we were
If that would free me from your chains
Help me forget your name

try to run I try to hide
I leave your memory behind
Like a shadow you won't leave
I take you everywhere with me
Take you everywhere with me

I can't shake you 
I can't make you go away
And I can't take this haunting me for one more day

try to run, I try to hide
Leave your memory behind
Like a shadow you won't leave
I take you everywhere with me

try to run, I try to hide
I leave your memory behind
But like a shadow you won't leave
I take you everywhere with me
Take you everywhere with me
 
   Driving in the poring rain
Wishing you would wash away
Thought I left you far behind
Back when we both said goodbye
Your in every face I see
Even strangers on the street
You live in this radio
There's nowhere that I can go

try to run, I try to hide
I leave your memory behind
Like a shadow you won't leave
I take you everywhere with me
Take you everywhere with me

I would walk across the world
A million miles from what we were
If that would free me from your chains
Help me forget your name

try to run I try to hide
I leave your memory behind
Like a shadow you won't leave
I take you everywhere with me
Take you everywhere with me

I can't shake you 
I can't make you go away
And I can't take this haunting me for one more day

try to run, I try to hide
Leave your memory behind
Like a shadow you won't leave
I take you everywhere with me

try to run, I try to hide
I leave your memory behind
But like a shadow you won't leave
I take you everywhere with me
Take you everywhere with me
 
   Jenny said when she was just five years old

You know there's nothing happenin' at all

Every time she puts on the radio

There was nothing going down at all

Then one fine mornin' she puts on a new york station

She couldn't believe what she heard at all

She started dancin' to that fine fine music

You know her life was saved by rock 'n' roll



Despite all the amputations

You could just dance to a rock 'n' roll station

And it was alright



Jenny said when she was just five years old

My parents are gonna be the death of us all

Two tv sets and two cadillac cars

Ain't gonna help us at all

Then one fine mornin' she puts on a new york station

She don't believe what she heard at all

She started dancin' to that fine fine music

You know her life was saved by rock 'n' roll



Despite all the computations

   Yeah it's been a long time coming

Never thought it'd take so long

I stood still but time kept running

Time has made me strong



Yeah it's been a long time waiting

Waiting for this day to come

Time don't wait so I keep singing



Yeah it's been a long time coming

Never thought it'd take so long

I stood still but time kept running

Time has made me strong

Made me strong, made me strong

   The day seems nice and bright and everything feels alright

I went to school without a fool tryin' to pick a fight

I was loced out Kris Kross shirt and some Khakis

Lookin' and feelin' like nothin' but a Mac, See

The bell rang and I got my dash

Feelin' good cause it was the last day of school and I passed

No mom's trippin' so me and my mom went dippin'

To celebrate the fact that I wasn't slippin'

The downtown scene was packed

People screamin' from they ride to my ride, ain't you da Mac I 

says I am what I am that's who I be

And Ya'll should have seen how they were tryin' to get to me

Kool, cause dissin' them don't pay they're the reason why we are

who we are to this very day

And all that love keeps me and Kris tight

Long as we give some love back everything's Alright

 

Now everything feels alright when I'm rollin' through my hood

And I see the one's that used to do the dirt done turn good

Lil kids tryin' to be like me, with the braids, the shades

Some pants like nike's gee

Ain't nothin' mo better than a letter sayin' 

I'm your number one fan, can you write me back man

Yes I try not to pass on an autograph, I try to do as many as I can

Now it feels good when I'm rollin' through my hood and ain't nobody

dissin' sayin' the nigga thinks he's too good

Cause, I'm down like four flat tires

Just a til nappy headed kid from the briar showin'

I can do right and not do wrong

Representing the Bee Gee's comin' up strong

and we ain't got no love for the other side, we only live this that

love us back right.

 

Now people seem to think what I do is a blast, cause I'm always on

the road and I'm makin' some cash

But they don't know really doe the pressure it is for some kids

tryin' to make it in this here biz

Early morning interviews, then we step to school

Step from School, back to interviews

then it's on to other dues

So warm it up Kris, I said warm it up Kris

That's what I was born to do

 

Now throw your hands in the air and wave 'em from side to side if

the feelin' that ya feelin' is a feelin' that's right

See I ain't come out wack, I came out right

Unlike those moes that chose to pass the mic

It's the Daddy Mac, Big Baby everything is real

but you want to want to diss because 

A nigga sold a couple of mil

Look here

You can't say nothing if you're last in the line

So when ya diss it just let's me know I'm on your mind

And it's Alright

   [Wyclef]

I want to send this one out to my vanilla ice-cream chocolate pudding pie

That stayed with me in the hood, do or die

Refugee camp



[Sharissa]

Yeah, this one goes out to my arm and joy

My banana that never split

The one that stuck with me



[Wyclef]

Before I had the bling bling

I thought I'd hit up in Sing Sing

Who would have ever thought that we'd be doing our thing

I know I did a little cheating

But once I got caught

I send you a parcel of roses

You sent them back and told me go to hell



[Wyclef]

But girl you know that, you take me as I am

Even though my fam don't understand

Why I put that rock up on your hand

That's 'cause you take me as I am (take me as I am)

And I don't know why you take me as I am

Even when my girls can't understand

You're my lady (you're my baby)

You're my baby (my honey)



[Wyclef]

You're the ocean that breathes that I feel when I'm blowing my trees alone



[Sharissa]

You're the sun that shines when the darkness strikes at night



[Wyclef]

You're the love of my life, you're my girl, you're my wife



[Sharissa]

You're mine, and I'm yours, you take me as I am

Wait a minute

Bring Noise Nigga, I got something on my shoulder - that bitch is so heavy
AK-47 a test ta a Mac-11, double clipped taped up
Ready ta spray something, 175 shots ta clear the block
I've rob through your neighborhood, day and night
Stole clothes people inside, ya hood on strike
I'm looking, for ya - high and low, nigga I'm searchin'
11 deep in the new Ford Excursion
Me and my nigga P. - brother D's on weed
Bet should re-infact, k' pot it clean
Once you found you get down, burn torchin' and beat
That's the treatment you get from a nigga in C.M.B.
I'm the B.G. but you can call me - Shot 'em up shorty
I'll get mad and try ta flush your head down the toirlet
Baby gave me the game - when this niggaz that's bitch made
Gimme my props, call it Ace a Ace a spade of spades nigga

[Juvenile]
Boss you wouldn't believe what happend ta me
Last night I got hit for a package of ki's
Who was it? Man I'ont know some cats
They kicked in my doo' shot my wife in the back
And you think them mothafuckers woulda left it at that
They beat me in my head until I said where it's at
Okay we go out in the streets and we get the word
We hit up anybody that we think selling them birds
Them fuckin moolignanis don't want no war'
C4 them down, let 'em burn in the car
Me not worried about no witness
'cause them won't see, anything linkin' up ta me
Boss, come ta find out it was Red and Black
Them connivin' motherfuckers gatta pay for that
I tell you what I gonna do, burn them cock roaches
And payment for the cops in case they wanna approach us

[Baby]
I'm the O.G. nigga 'bout money and bitches
Know how, ta flip a brick and deal with ditches
My brother K.C. told me how ta kill these niggaz
While Troy had me in alleys dealin' with digits
Aiy, life is real my nigga, me and Lac pa' was killed my nigga
It ain't nothing keep it real my nigga
While my homies carve life in the field my nigga
Ski' then family - thrill deal niggaz
Rambo and Sam - it is what it is niggaz
I've robbed niggaz - pulled triggers for niggaz
Drama's involved - we in like we in nigga
Homicide - we kill like we kill nigga
Behind them thangs - it is what it is niggaz
Birdman - a known shotcaller
Suburban man and Benzes and Prowlers


[Lil' Wayne]
(look - look - look - look)
Here comes Mister Bad nerves
What that fed up look?
Shorty got that do whatever for the cheddar look
And got no dope, weed or fetti plus I'm hurt and hungry
All I got is this beretta with 2 murders on it
I done walk 'bout four blocks
In a pair of old 'Boks
Dirty with no socks
Looking for dope spots
Man I'm on the prawl - untamed and wild
Been a year since I smiled
Better watch that child
Hat over my eyes, you can't see my frustation
Looking at niggaz paper chasin' with mean faces
Was told wait my turn - but damn I'm in-pacient
Pacin' the streets, with, the, mac-10 blazin'
Lil' Brother bail please, I'ma kill him for the scrilla
Do you under smell me - I'm telling your dawg
I was raised on bad ways from school on half-days
Have smart and have praise - stop playin' with me

[Turk]
It's in my bloodstream wodie, ta be the nigga that I am
Tote gats with hats take a nigga from his fam'
Nothin' but streets shit - it's all a nigga know
Knockin you off ya feet quick - it's all a nigga know
Drive-bys in you-Hauls - prepared anyday
Thuggin' is usual, do that every day
Bitch niggaz get roast, if your not from round my way
Middle of the court or one of them hallways
Quick ta steal ya, I'm real I ain't fake
Leave ya ass a murder scene in the middle of yellow tape
Put a hole in ya thinkin' cap, won't be thinkin no mo'
You'll be put ta nap
Young nigga play it raw, raw - X ya bitch ass out
Me and my nigga Rat quick ta run up in ya house
Fuck it, I goes out 'cause it's in me my nigga
When it's a coke drought - I tote a semi my nigga

My friend well he walked me down

These roads I've never known

The salvation of my soul 

Myself the only goal

There were pleasures I thought I'd seen

And some I never knew

There were people dressed in rainments

Of an uncertain hue

And the chances I thought I'd had

Many I'd missed

There were devils bearing gifts

And angels on the piss



For my sins I will confess

And I will never lie

There's nobody that was ever here

That's never wondered why

And I've lived my life the best

Every second to defy

Will nobody that was ever here

Grieve me when I die



On the first day I met myself 

Coming back from the third

I believed in what I was doing

I swallowed every word

Every word that I was told

By the great and the good

I bit the poisoned apple 

'cause I felt that I should



And now that I come to it 

I can't recall

What it was I achieved

Just before my fall

I saw visions of ugliness 

I visited shame

But I know should I come to it 

I'd do it all again

   There's a blank space in this photograph

I don't remember what made me laugh

I'm not happy, though I seem to be

Where your face should have been

Only whispering wind



I don't care anymore

If you say it's the end

I'll still be your best friend

I don't care if you're cruel

I don't care if you're dead

I'll still be your best friend



So don't cry, rainy eyes, I'll carry on

When all the honest people are gone

But you gave up ~whoa~ so easy

On the noise that we made

Something gold that could stay



I don't care if your gun has

A bullet for me

I really mean it, you

Still need a best friend 



There's a blank space in this photograph

I don't remember what made me laugh



I don't care anymore

If you say it's the end

I'll still be your best friend

I don't care if you

Flake out all over again

I'll still be your best friend



Oh, you still need a best friend

   Where you're at

You shouldn't be

Although I wish I was there too

Back and forth

Through the course

Of the last few years

My mind is not made up

Still

Do you lie



To everyone

You don't have to lie to me

Is your sight

Without light

You can't see me in the dark

When will I start working for me

When will I stand tall like the trees

Am I just paying for sin

Still

Still 
   I set the fire ablaze

Lit it from far away

Found it out yesterday

Called it a big mistake

A wake up call for me

Figured it would be

That the story of this man

Never was a plan

Incompatible worlds we can't control

But that's the way it's always been

Circumstantial human beings

By the way I'll be ok

So why aren't you the first to say

Today I'm born again

Call it a big mistake

To see it fade away

But the problem's not with me

So now I'm twenty two

Feeling kind of blue

Because the same thing's happening

Instead it's now my friends

The choices we all make

Could prove life long mistakes

But I don't want to see your life fall right on through your hands

By the way I'll be ok

So why aren't you the first to say

I wish this never happened

I wonder what my life would be like now

If things just kind of went my way

Today you're born again

So now you're twenty-one

With no worries

Now you're twenty-one

With no worries

Now you're twenty-one

Only twenty-one years young

   When lady luck has got me down with her high-speed attitude

We don't need no education 

The rhythm that you're giving me is changing my life 

And baby if you said “jump” I'd say “how high” 

No dealing, stealing 

Only free-wheeling

Identity is the crisis canÃ‚Â´t you see

Identity identity

Oh when you look in the mirror 

Do you smash it quick

Do you take the glass

And slash your wrists

Did you do it for fame 

Did you do it in a fit

Did you do it before

You read about it 
   Identity

Identity is the crisis canÃ‚Â´t you see

Identity, identity

Oh when you look in the mirror 

Do you see yourself [Repeat: x1]

On the TV screen

Do you see yourself in the magazine

When you see yourself

Does it make you scream

Identity is the crisis canÃ‚Â´t you see

Identity identity, yeah

Identity is the crisis canÃ‚Â´t you see

Identity identity

Oh when you look in the mirror 

Do you smash it quick

Do you take the glass

And slash your wrists

Did you do it for fame 

Did you do it in a fit

Did you do it before

You read about it 
   Hope climbs atop of the piano

Reaching out towards the warmth of the sun

Some man tries to ask her down

But now maybe that's where she belongs

My God she said,

I'm the sunflower who wants

My god he said,

This woman is gone

Into the dark

Is there anybody there

My god she said

He climbed up top to find that she was slipping

Let her go, let her go, let me go

How long must we leave before we're winning

They don't know, they don't know they just don't know

If she can't be there I know it's best that

Nothing is denied

If she can't be there it's best that

Everyone change sides

In my mind, in my mind 

A world of enchantment

Being sung through my mind

In my mind, visual enhancement



And I find myself 

In a red painted barn

A million stars 

They pick me up and spin me



And now I am floating 

In a land of confusion

Or is it reality 

Or just an illusion

And nothing makes sense

No start and no end

When you get more

Is when you get bored



In my mind, in my mind

Turning the handle 

And it's starting to stain

In my mind burns like a candle



And the wax tells a fairy tale

My head's for sale

I'm swimming through the hail



And now I am floating 

In a land of confusion

Or is it reality 

Or just an illusion

And nothing makes sense

No start and no end

   I've sworn my love

I've been reborn my love

Don't be forlorn my love

I've torn my heart

Do not mourn my depart

I've been reborn my love



I'm watching you

There's nothing they can do

Now I'm reborn my love



Yeah, you must believe you'll live on without me

I'm leaving all my love



I am awake

And you are only dreaming

You'll be o.k. and you will find some meaning

You will not break

Though you'll buckle with feelings

I am awake and you are only dreaming



Don't fear my friend

'Cause there is no real end

I've been reborn my love

I'm happy here

I have nothing to fear

I'm getting all the love, oh yeah



So shed a tear

For all the happy years

And just move on my love

I'll ride this crowd

And when your time comes 'round

We'll need all our love
