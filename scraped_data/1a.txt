 There's nothing real about your fight

Nothing in the shit you write

You've got charisma in your hair

The make up lady put it there, and it's

One, one plus two is three, can't we get along?

You bring it on, The Monkey Kong

 Nothing

No way

You only get it once

 6 o'clock on a tube stop, waiting for a subway train
On my own, so alone, why does everybody look the same?
To the right there's a sign, telling me which way to go
To the left there's an old man shouting at the radio, radio

Get out, get out, get out, yeah
Get out, get out, get out
Get out, get out, get out, yeah

6 o'clock on a tube stop, waiting for a subway train
On my own, so alone, why does everybody look the same?
There's a man with a gold band but he's got his eye on mine
There's a bomb in a sports bag, could go off at any time, at any time

When my knees don't work I start to shake
I won't panic, I won't hesitate
It's alright, it's okay
The daylight is that way
And we all go the same way

6 O 12 and I'm not well, gonna have a heart attack
Everyone is a bum, I'm gonna get my money back
Over there there's a square, talking to his telephone
Then he stares at my hair and suddenly I'm not alone, I'm not alone

Get out, get out, get out, yeah
Get out, get out, get out

When my knees don't work I start to shake
I won't panic, I won't hesitate

 Suck it up, we're going down

30 seconds 'till we smash into the ground

The passengers have lost their smiles

Soon their bodies will be wreckage spread for miles 



I'm in the shit, knee-deep in it, I think that this might hurt a bit

I leave my debts but no regrets - except I wish I'd took the train 



Another day, another flight

There's not a chance of going down, but I just might

So this is it, this is goodbye

And I feel like I'm gonna lose my mind 



I'm in the shit, knee-deep in it, I think that this might hurt a bit

I leave my debts but no regrets - except I wish I'd took the train 



Everybody has their day and I guess I'm just the same

But I'm going nowhere

Everybody has their day, never thought it would be this way

And I really don't care 



I'm in the shit, knee-deep in it, I think that this might hurt a bit

I leave my debts but no regrets - except I wish I'd took the train 



We're going down, we're out of sky

It sure helps if you can see the funny side

So this is over and out, this is goodbye

And I'm feeling like I'm gonna lose my mind 



I try to reach her, but she's not there

But back home I hope she knows how much I care

I ease the seat back and start to pray

To the same God that puts bombs in cargo bays  
 Suck it up, we're going down

30 seconds 'till we smash into the ground

The passengers have lost their smiles

Soon their bodies will be wreckage spread for miles 



I'm in the shit, knee-deep in it, I think that this might hurt a bit

I leave my debts but no regrets - except I wish I'd took the train 



Another day, another flight

There's not a chance of going down, but I just might

So this is it, this is goodbye

And I feel like I'm gonna lose my mind 



I'm in the shit, knee-deep in it, I think that this might hurt a bit

I leave my debts but no regrets - except I wish I'd took the train 



Everybody has their day and I guess I'm just the same

But I'm going nowhere

Everybody has their day, never thought it would be this way

And I really don't care 



I'm in the shit, knee-deep in it, I think that this might hurt a bit

I leave my debts but no regrets - except I wish I'd took the train 



We're going down, we're out of sky

It sure helps if you can see the funny side

So this is over and out, this is goodbye

And I'm feeling like I'm gonna lose my mind 



I try to reach her, but she's not there

But back home I hope she knows how much I care

I ease the seat back and start to pray

To the same God that puts bombs in cargo bays  
 Five pretty boys for ten shitty years

Five girls next door, I'm up to my ears

I need a reaction, a new revolution

All over the country, 'cause they took it away 



They took it away, it can't be impossible

They're playing the records that they play in hospital

Radio playlist for the terminally ill

You can't tell they're miming 'till you're over the hill 



And it goes on (and on, and on, and on)

And it goes on (and on, and on, and on) 



If you put it like that, you'll be dead some day

Set the record straight - they took it all away 



They took it away, left us with nothing

Second-hand hits and million misses

Nobody means it, they're making up stories

You gotta blame someone, you can't blame the Tories 



I blame myself, I want an easy life

Does it really matter, ain't worth no suicide

The bigger they come, the harder they fall

I'm kicking myself for wasting it all 



And it goes on (and on, and on, and on)

And it goes on (and on, and on, and on) 



If you put it like that, you'll be dead some day

Set the record straight - they took it all away 



They took it away, left us with nothing



You suffer the pain of your fingers burning



And it goes on (and on, and on, and on)

And it goes on (and on, and on, and on) 



If you put it like that, you'll be dead some day

Set the record straight - they took it all away

 Air on the streets, lights on the trees

Eight days a week, singer's disease

I want to be where the sun meets the sky

I want to be there, it's out of your mind

And I believe in the secrets you're keeping

I want to piece of the air when I breathe in

I want to be the gold underneath the stream

Having my moment, you know what I mean 



Oh, it's a blue sky

And the headlights, and the headlines

It's a new day, for a new wave

It's a perfect moment, oh

I'm moving out, for a moment in The Springs 



Out of my way, Berlin to L.A.

I want to stay here and never go home again

I want to be the grass underneath your feet

I want to be the shops on your high street

And I believe in the secrets you're keeping

I want to be your alarm when you sleep in

I want to be the one you can be around

I want to be the one who can make you proud 



Oh, it's a blue sky

And the headlights, and the headlines

It's a new day, for a new wave

Get a voice, don't get a doctor

That's your choice, no-one can stop you

I want to be the one you can be around

I want to be the one who can make you proud

Got a job, I don't got no pension

In it for love - money's too tight to mention

I want to be in the rockin'est city

I want to do what I want if it kills me

Have to say, your home's where you make it

It's OK, I know when you fake it

I want to be the gum on your train seat

I want to stand up and walk on my own feet

I want to be the one you can be around

I want to be the rock underneath your ground

I want to be the one who can make you proud

I want to be the one you can be around

 So come out fighting, second's out

Who's the daddy? Well there's no doubt

Got on thing on your brain, you all act the same

But you're alright 



'Cause you are from Venus and I am from Mars

You'd like your penis as big as your car

Not so good in the sack - so what, d'ya want your money back?!

Yeah, you're alright 



It's just as far as you can go, without going back again

Yeah, you know I'm right so shut yer face

It's just as far as you can go, without going back again

Yeah, you know I'm right so shut yer face

You wait till I'm watching the football - and then you talk!

You're never wrong, so bring it on

'Cause you're alright

'Cause I are from Venus and you am from Mars

You buy me panties that don't match my bras

Why so long in the bathroom? Baby I have to

Then it's alright

Yeah, you know I'm right so shut yer face

I bet you think you know the place

It's just as far as you can go, without going back again

Yeah, you know I'm right so shut yer face

You never listen anyway



Smacking you, whacking you, flat out attacking you

Beating you down with my words over you

You're too hot to handle - maybe you're mental

But you're alright

 It's OK to beat the living shit from the drum kit

It's OK to take what you don't have, if you want it 



That's alright, that's your way

Water's cold, December, Del Ray

Through those eyes, made me cry

And the summer is forever

It's the endless summer 



And it's not about your girlfriend

And it's not about your boyfriend

And I'm not about to lose it over you

Remember what I told ya

The night in California

And I'm all about Pacific Ocean Blue 



It's OK to leave your jacket on in the ocean

It's OK to sing the saddest song, Vibrations 



Thanks a lot, you can be

What you want, honestly

Magic days, golden nights

And the summer is forever

It's the endless summer 



And it's not about your girlfriend

And it's not about your boyfriend

And I'm not about to lose it over you

All I got is best intentions

I got fears, too much to mention 



You're not there, when I'm scared, terrified

Jump right in, the water's fine

 I'm so tired, I need sleep

I'm talking to my pillow case, what's wrong with me?

I make mistakes, but them's the breaks

I'm crying out for anyone to come and rescue me 

Talk about a new wave (Whoa-oh, whoa-oh!)

Talk about a way to save the day (Whoa-oh, whoa-oh!) 

Talk about a new world

Just not today 

Hey there, why you look so sad?

What made you so mad that you can't

You can't get over it

Hey there, why you look so hurt?

You get what you deserve, you know, here we go

Why don't you cry about it? 

Life's a bitch, and so am I

 Right back at you, record three

Makes you wish that you were me

'Cause we got no job for life

Build 'em up like Frank Lloyd Wright

No two days turn out the same

Only sleeping on the plane

Not exactly Monkey days

C'mon, rock it up, from the back to the front, go! 



So get your, so get your ears on

So get your, so get your ears on

'Cause I'm Hi-Fi, Hi-Fi

I'm serious, so come on 



So get your, so get your ears on

So get your, so get your ears on

'Cause I'm Hi-Fi, Hi-Fi

I'm serious, bring it on! 



Banshee wailing from my throat

Only dogs can hear the notes

Be myself to pay the bills

From L.A. to Skillmans Hill

We've done time for stealing shows

There ain't nothing we don't know

Plug us in and watch us go! 



C'mon, rock it up, we're all about to jump from the back to the front, go! 



So get your, so get your ears on

So get your, so get your ears on

'Cause I'm Hi-Fi, Hi-Fi

I'm serious, so come on 



So get your, so get your ears on

So get your, so get your ears on

'Cause I'm Hi-Fi, Hi-Fi

I'm serious, bring it on! 



Hot, like the desert sky

You're so cool on the inside

You hate being recognised

Going off on outside 



Gotta get up, gotta get out, picking it up, gotta get up, gotta get out

Gotta get up, gotta get out, picking it up, gotta get up, gotta get out

Gotta get up, gotta get out, picking it up, gotta get up, gotta get out

Got a fever and I want to clear my lungs! 



Coming round for one more go

Way too loud for radio

Mosh pit full of casualties

OAP's get in for free

Time to even out the score

Thought we'd done enough before

Now we're kicking down your door 



Come on, rock it up, to the back

Measure twice, cut it once

Clear the room, we're barbequeing up for lunch! 



So get your, so get your ears on

So get your, so get your ears on

'Cause I'm Hi-Fi, Hi-Fi

I'm serious, so come on 



So get your, so get your ears on

So get your, so get your ears on

'Cause I'm Hi-Fi, Hi-Fi

I'm serious, bring it on!

Got a fever and I want to clear my lungs! 



Coming round for one more go

Way too loud for radio

Mosh pit full of casualties

OAP's get in for free

Time to even out the score

Thought we'd done enough before

Now we're kicking down your door 



Come on, rock it up, to the back

Measure twice, cut it once

Clear the room, we're barbequeing up for lunch! 



So get your, so get your ears on

So get your, so get your ears on

'Cause I'm Hi-Fi, Hi-Fi

I'm serious, so come on 



So get your, so get your ears on

 Nothing

 6 o'clock on a tube stop, waiting for a subway train
On my own, so alone, why does everybody look the same?
To the right there's a sign, telling me which way to go
To the left there's an old man shouting at the radio, radio

Get out, get out, get out, yeah
Get out, get out, get out
Get out, get out, get out, yeah

6 o'clock on a tube stop, waiting for a subway train
On my own, so alone, why does everybody look the same?
There's a man with a gold band but he's got his eye on mine
There's a bomb in a sports bag, could go off at any time, at any time

When my knees don't work I start to shake
I won't panic, I won't hesitate
It's alright, it's okay
The daylight is that way
And we all go the same way

6 O 12 and I'm not well, gonna have a heart attack
Everyone is a bum, I'm gonna get my money back
Over there there's a square, talking to his telephone
Then he stares at my hair and suddenly I'm not alone, I'm not alone

Get out, get out, get out, yeah
Get out, get out, get out

When my knees don't work I start to shake
I won't panic, I won't hesitate

 Suck it up, we're going down

30 seconds 'till we smash into the ground

The passengers have lost their smiles

Soon their bodies will be wreckage spread for miles 



I'm in the shit, knee-deep in it, I think that this might hurt a bit

I leave my debts but no regrets - except I wish I'd took the train 



Another day, another flight

There's not a chance of going down, but I just might

So this is it, this is goodbye

And I feel like I'm gonna lose my mind 



I'm in the shit, knee-deep in it, I think that this might hurt a bit

I leave my debts but no regrets - except I wish I'd took the train 



Everybody has their day and I guess I'm just the same

But I'm going nowhere

Everybody has their day, never thought it would be this way

And I really don't care 



I'm in the shit, knee-deep in it, I think that this might hurt a bit

I leave my debts but no regrets - except I wish I'd took the train 



We're going down, we're out of sky

It sure helps if you can see the funny side

So this is over and out, this is goodbye

And I'm feeling like I'm gonna lose my mind 



I try to reach her, but she's not there

But back home I hope she knows how much I care

I ease the seat back and start to pray

To the same God that puts bombs in cargo bays

 Five pretty boys for ten shitty years

Five girls next door, I'm up to my ears

I need a reaction, a new revolution

All over the country, 'cause they took it away 



They took it away, it can't be impossible

They're playing the records that they play in hospital

Radio playlist for the terminally ill

You can't tell they're miming 'till you're over the hill 



And it goes on (and on, and on, and on)

And it goes on (and on, and on, and on) 



If you put it like that, you'll be dead some day

Set the record straight - they took it all away 



They took it away, left us with nothing

Second-hand hits and million misses

Nobody means it, they're making up stories

You gotta blame someone, you can't blame the Tories 



I blame myself, I want an easy life

Does it really matter, ain't worth no suicide

The bigger they come, the harder they fall

I'm kicking myself for wasting it all 



And it goes on (and on, and on, and on)

And it goes on (and on, and on, and on) 



If you put it like that, you'll be dead some day

Set the record straight - they took it all away 



They took it away, left us with nothing



You suffer the pain of your fingers burning



And it goes on (and on, and on, and on)

And it goes on (and on, and on, and on) 



If you put it like that, you'll be dead some day

Set the record straight - they took it all away

 Air on the streets, lights on the trees

Eight days a week, singer's disease

I want to be where the sun meets the sky

I want to be there, it's out of your mind

And I believe in the secrets you're keeping

I want to piece of the air when I breathe in

I want to be the gold underneath the stream

Having my moment, you know what I mean 



Oh, it's a blue sky

And the headlights, and the headlines

It's a new day, for a new wave

It's a perfect moment, oh

I'm moving out, for a moment in The Springs 



Out of my way, Berlin to L.A.

I want to stay here and never go home again

I want to be the grass underneath your feet

I want to be the shops on your high street

And I believe in the secrets you're keeping

I want to be your alarm when you sleep in

I want to be the one you can be around

I want to be the one who can make you proud 



Oh, it's a blue sky

And the headlights, and the headlines

It's a new day, for a new wave

It's a perfect moment, oh

I'm moving out, for a moment in The Springs 



Get a voice, don't get a doctor

That's your choice, no-one can stop you

I want to be the one you can be around

I want to be the one who can make you proud

Got a job, I don't got no pension

In it for love - money's too tight to mention

I want to be in the rockin'est city

I want to do what I want if it kills me

Have to say, your home's where you make it

It's OK, I know when you fake it

I want to be the gum on your train seat

I want to stand up and walk on my own feet

I want to be the one you can be around

I want to be the rock underneath your ground

I want to be the one who can make you proud

I want to be the one you can be around

I want to be the one you can be around  
 Air on the streets, lights on the trees

Eight days a week, singer's disease

I want to be where the sun meets the sky

I want to be there, it's out of your mind

And I believe in the secrets you're keeping

I want to piece of the air when I breathe in

I want to be the gold underneath the stream

Having my moment, you know what I mean 



Oh, it's a blue sky

And the headlights, and the headlines

It's a new day, for a new wave

It's a perfect moment, oh

I'm moving out, for a moment in The Springs

 So come out fighting, second's out

Who's the daddy? Well there's no doubt

Got on thing on your brain, you all act the same

But you're alright 



'Cause you are from Venus and I am from Mars

You'd like your penis as big as your car

Not so good in the sack - so what, d'ya want your money back?!

Yeah, you're alright 



It's just as far as you can go, without going back again

Yeah, you know I'm right so shut yer face

I bet you think you know the place

It's just as far as you can go, without going back again

Yeah, you know I'm right so shut yer face

You never listen anyway 



It's the way that you're scratching your balls when you walk

You wait till I'm watching the football - and then you talk!

You're never wrong, so bring it on

'Cause you're alright

'Cause I are from Venus and you am from Mars

You buy me panties that don't match my bras

Why so long in the bathroom? Baby I have to

Then it's alright



It's just as far as you can go, without going back again

Yeah, you know I'm right so shut yer face

I bet you think you know the place

It's just as far as you can go, without going back again

Yeah, you know I'm right so shut yer face

You never listen anyway



Smacking you, whacking you, flat out attacking you

Beating you down with my words over you

You're too hot to handle - maybe you're mental

But you're alright



It's just as far as you can go, without going back again

Yeah, you know I'm right so shut yer face

I bet you think you know the place

It's just as far as you can go, without going back again

 It's OK to beat the living shit from the drum kit

It's OK to take what you don't have, if you want it 



That's alright, that's your way

Water's cold, December, Del Ray

Through those eyes, made me cry

And the summer is forever

It's the endless summer 



And it's not about your girlfriend

And it's not about your boyfriend

And I'm not about to lose it over you

Remember what I told ya

The night in California

And I'm all about Pacific Ocean Blue 



It's OK to leave your jacket on in the ocean

It's OK to sing the saddest song, Vibrations 



Thanks a lot, you can be

What you want, honestly

Magic days, golden nights

And the summer is forever

It's the endless summer 



And it's not about your girlfriend

And it's not about your boyfriend

And I'm not about to lose it over you

Remember what I told ya

The night in California

And I'm all about Pacific Ocean Blue 



I don't need no explanation

All I got is best intentions

I got fears, too much to mention 



You're not there, when I'm scared, terrified

Jump right in, the water's fine

 We go the distance till there's nowhere left to go

It's complicated, don't you hate what you've become? Oh yeah! 



Running out of luck

Trying to keep it punk

You can only let yourself down

Afraid of what you know

A square shape in a round hole

You know, it goes in tight,

Goes in tight



We go the distance till there's nowhere left to go

It's complicated, don't you hate what you've become?



You're running out of time

You're never going nowhere

The best is all behind you

You're spending your cash like a man with no hands

Keepin' it real like your favourite bands

If they don't try

Then we don't buy, we don't buy



It's the distance, it's the distance

It's the distance, the position between me and you

So stand up, so get up

So stand up, so get up

 I'm so tired, I need sleep

I'm talking to my pillow case, what's wrong with me?

I make mistakes, but them's the breaks

I'm crying out for anyone to come and rescue me 

Talk about a new wave (Whoa-oh, whoa-oh!)

Talk about a way to save the day (Whoa-oh, whoa-oh!) 

Talk about a new world

Just not today 

Hey there, why you look so sad?

What made you so mad that you can't

You can't get over it

Hey there, why you look so hurt?

You get what you deserve, you know, here we go

Why don't you cry about it? 

Life's a bitch, and so am I

If you want it bad enough, there's lots of easy ways to die

No homies, so lonely

Why don't you cry about it now?

 Right back at you, record three

Makes you wish that you were me

'Cause we got no job for life

Build 'em up like Frank Lloyd Wright

No two days turn out the same

Only sleeping on the plane

Not exactly Monkey days

C'mon, rock it up, from the back to the front, go! 



So get your, so get your ears on

So get your, so get your ears on

'Cause I'm Hi-Fi, Hi-Fi

I'm serious, so come on 



So get your, so get your ears on

So get your, so get your ears on

'Cause I'm Hi-Fi, Hi-Fi

I'm serious, bring it on! 



Banshee wailing from my throat

Only dogs can hear the notes

Be myself to pay the bills

From L.A. to Skillmans Hill

We've done time for stealing shows

There ain't nothing we don't know

Plug us in and watch us go! 



C'mon, rock it up, we're all about to jump from the back to the front, go! 



So get your, so get your ears on

So get your, so get your ears on

'Cause I'm Hi-Fi, Hi-Fi

I'm serious, so come on 



So get your, so get your ears on

So get your, so get your ears on

'Cause I'm Hi-Fi, Hi-Fi

I'm serious, bring it on! 



Hot, like the desert sky

You're so cool on the inside

You hate being recognised

Going off on outside 



Gotta get up, gotta get out, picking it up, gotta get up, gotta get out

Gotta get up, gotta get out, picking it up, gotta get up, gotta get out

Gotta get up, gotta get out, picking it up, gotta get up, gotta get out

Got a fever and I want to clear my lungs! 



Coming round for one more go

Way too loud for radio

Mosh pit full of casualties

OAP's get in for free

Time to even out the score

Thought we'd done enough before

Now we're kicking down your door 



Come on, rock it up, to the back

Measure twice, cut it once

Clear the room, we're barbequeing up for lunch! 



So get your, so get your ears on

So get your, so get your ears on

'Cause I'm Hi-Fi, Hi-Fi

I'm serious, so come on 



So get your, so get your ears on

 Nothing

And nothing's where you're at

 Met a man who said he's got a villa down in Africa

I asked him what he's doing here, the weather sucks, what's wrong with ya?



He said he's got a gun, and that he's on the run

He used to have a life but it went wrong



Girlfriend's in a coma

He's promised to look after her

He's written to her favourite bands

He's hoping for Metallica



It all looks pretty grim

He wishes it were him

He used to have a life but it went wrong



And he said

Hey, what you living for?

Hey, what you looking for?

I'm not gonna take it any more

Is anybody there? Is anybody out?

Is anybody up? Is anybody down?



I don't think I can take it any more

I don't think I can take it any more



She's cruising in her wheelchair

She's dressed up like [a mexican]

She's holding up the traffic and there's gonna be an accident



I bet she lives alone

Is anybody home?

She used to have a life but it went wrong



And she says

Hey, what you living for?

Hey, what you learning for?

I'm not gonna take it any more

 I have fallen down a manhole

Up the river without paddle

I can't stand up on my own feet

Something came along and bit me



You're all over the place

When she wipes that grin off your face

And you don't know what day it is

Don't even know your name



She's getting me off

She's turning me on

I hope she does that to herself, when I am gone



I don't get the situation

We're an overnight sensation



You feel like you could drop

But she's coming ready or not

And you don't know the place to start, you don't know where to stop



She's getting me off

She's turning me on

I hope she does that to herself, when I am gone



She's checking me out

I'm losing the fight, yeah

I'm so retarded for that girl, and that's alright



You're all over the place

When she wipes that grin off your face

And you don't know what day it is

Don't even know your name

It's so great, I want to stay home every night

 As we grow up I feel the tension

Its all around me

I can't explain this apprehension

And then its the next day

This state of mind

I fail to define

Forced to contend like you

Watch that your not silenced too 

We can dissent

Yeah, we can change ourselves

But don't pretend

Prioritize your values 

I've reached a point of deep despondence

It premeates me

A constant weigh upon my conscience

Now we've gotta change

The way we act

We should watch each others backs

Global equality at the expensive of state economies 

Let go

 I wonder wonder wonder
Wonder what went wrong
We used to used to used to 
Used to feel so strong
Now we seem to come apart at the seam
Now we speak impolitely
Now it's a fight to be nice
And you know it ain't right

I remember member member
Member what we had
We used to used to used to
Used to love so madly
Now we speak impolitely
Now we struggle even nightly

Who is replaceable
Who is reciprocal
Who is responsible

 On and on like a rush song, like a long one
You're the miss in the partnership, yeah, the right one
There will come a day when I'll bury you
I will go the same way, together
Whatever there awaits us I'm gonna get through

And the closest thing to Jesus is suffering
And the closest thing between us is air
Don't say a word, that's not enough

Makes me sick when I think of it in the wrong way
Shitting bricks when I enter it in my bad brains
Like a wound up toy I'm kicking and a screaming
Emo boy, naive and semi functioning
Hey, this is a love song, hands up if you feel it

 You like snow but only if it's warm

You like rain but only if it's dry

There's no sentimental value to the rose that fell on your floor

There's no fundamental excuse for the granted I'm taken for



'Cause it's easy not to

So much easier not to

And what goes around never comes around to you



You like pain but only if it doesn't hurt too much

And you sit, and you wait, to receive

There's an obvious attraction

To the path of least resistance in your life

Well there's an obvious aversion no amount of my insistence

Could make you try tonight



'Cause it's easy not to

So much easier not to

And what goes around never comes around to you

To you, to you, to you, to you, to you



There's no love, no money, no thrill anymore



There's an apprehensive naked little trembling boy

With his head in his hands

And there's an underestimated and impatient little girl

Raising her hand



But it's easy not to

So much easier not to

And what goes around never comes around to you

To you, to you



Get up, get up, get up off of it

Get up, get up, get up off of it

Get out, get outta here, enough already

Get up, get up, get up off of it

Wake up  
 You like snow but only if it's warm

 Some days go on forever, 

Last long into the night, 

Some days feel like December, although its warm on the inside. 

Forget the middle of summer, 

I bet you I am alive. 

We'll wipe the floors together, nice try. 



Save it all, 

You have all the answers, 

Thank you for the memories and hope you go with it. 

Crying out, 

You have all the anger, 

Blame it on yourself again, there's nothing wrong with it. 

You're a black hole! 



Some days are complicated, 

Some ways i'll take the blame, 

Some days i take it all to, heart again. 

This place is made of panic, 

They check you every mile, 

Thank god you're going out for, a while.

Crying out, 

You have all the anger, 

Blame it on yourself again, there's nothing wrong with it. 

You're a black hole! 

You're a black hole! 

You're a black hole!  
 Hang on, don't be frightened, 

Hold on, keep the light on, 

You call me anytime you want to. 

Keep a night in summer, 

Don't cry when its over, 

You take me anywhere you need to. 



Like its your birthday, 

Like on your first date, 



Hey! You're gonna make it in your own way! 

You're gonna make it in your own way! 

Hey! You gotta make it in your own way! 

Or you're gonna fall... 



Come on, getting violent, 

Be strong, and don't be frightened, 

That's crazy talk where out from hold you lost this. 

Go where the weather takes you, 

Don't care, they'll never break you, 

Love is all we needed in the first place.

Hey! You gotta make it in your own way! 

Hey! You gotta make it in your own way! 

Hey! You gotta make it in your own way! 

Or don't make it at all... 



Days'll never feel the same, 

I get your tears, I feel your pain, 

I know two people that think the same, 

I'm giving you your own way.

 Standing with a headache
I try to fight but I can't deny the pain
Reservations what I got
From the bottom to the top

On the bottle, 5 times a day
Standing with the top line
You know it's gonna hurt when I close my eyes
And I'm shaking and I feel so alive

Stand up and face it
Get up, don't waste it
What's the worst thing that could happen?
What's the worst thing that could happen?

You're bored out of ya mind
Fighting all the time
What's the worst thing that could happen?
What's the worst thing that could happen to you?

When there's nothing on
You find yourself caught in the spotlight
You try to fight but you can't delight the phase
On your knees is what you're not

Keeping what you got
Don't try to hide your face, caught in a flashlight
You know it's gonna hurt when I close my eyes
And I'm breaking and I feel so alive

Stand up and face it
Get up, don't waste it
What's the worst thing that could happen?
What's the worst thing that could happen?

You're bored out of ya mind
Fighting all the time
What's the worst thing that could happen?
What's the worst thing that could happen to you?

When there's nothing right
When there's nothing right

Stand up and face it
Get up, don't waste it
What's the worst thing that could happen?
What's the worst thing that could happen?

You're bored out of ya mind
Fighting all the time
What's the worst thing that could happen?

 Afterburner, after burning out, 

There's a news alert in ??, 

And some poor kid who drowned. 

Operator, operating round, 

Could you take a chance in our romance, 

You did nothing about. 



Oooo ooo, 

Take it like a man and do without. 

Oooo ooo, 

It takes a century to figure out. 

Oooo ooo, 

Making like we know what its about. 

Oooo ooo, 

Talk about it. 



After burning out. 

After burning out. 

After burning out. 

Times when I've forgotten you're around. 



Ten years later, 

I can't believe its dead, 

What we lost you're in without it started coming round again. 

Space invader, 

Tried it on again, 

I thought your tapes alone and your face is gone, and they're never gonna end. 



Oooo ooo,

After burning out. 

After burning out. 

After burning out. 

Times when I've forgotten you're around. 



And I know this night, 

Is another place. 

It can take another day, 

So you don't look back again. 

(don't look... back!) 

Yeah! 



After burner,

Stay away, you're burning out.

Stay away, you're burning out. 

After burning out, 

Stay away, you're burning out. 

After burning out, 

Stay away, you're burning out.
