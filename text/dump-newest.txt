* &lt;small&gt;(19 Sep 2009)&lt;/small&gt;  Lyriki has not only been updated to the latest version of MediaWiki (1.15.1), but also to a new server!  It's still running off of the old one until DNS has updated, but once that happens the site should be much faster.  Until then, http://test.lyriki.com should be the faster version, all content the same.
* &lt;small&gt;(18 Jun 2008)&lt;/small&gt;  Wiki-Lyrics script [[Help:Wiki-Lyrics Script#Submitting Policy|submitting policy]] has been updated. Everyone using the script to submit content to the site should read it.
* &lt;small&gt;(30 Apr 2008)&lt;/small&gt;  Database dumps in xml format have been put up, for those who wish to mirror or keep backups of lyriki.  The newest file is always available at http://lyriki.com/dbdumps/dump-newest.bz2 (warning, ~20 mb)
* &lt;small&gt;(25 Dec 2007)&lt;/small&gt;  Many templates are receiving major, much-needed revisions... please excuse the broken pages.
* &lt;small&gt;(30 Oct 2007) &lt;/small&gt;  Due to the constant anonymous vandalism, '''anonymous editing has been disabled indefinitely'''.
* Not new, but, definitely in need of exposure.  [irc://irc.freenode.net/lyriki #Lyriki] on irc.freenode.net could definitely use some more company.

Before contributing, you must [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].  Next, please look at the [[Help:Contents|help section]], specifically the pages on adding new [[Help:Adding New Songs|songs]], [[Help:Adding New Albums|albums]] and [[Help:Adding New Artists|artists]].  These pages contain templates that should be used when entering lyrics or other information.  This gives pages a consistant look and feel, and ensures that all the information shows up properly in the indexes.

Contributing lyrics should be done by listening to the song and transcribing the words as best you can. Don't worry about making mistakes; someone else will offer corrections, and eventually the community should be able to come to a consensus as to what the proper lyrics are.

To contribute artist or album information, you should either transcribe the information from your own CDs or gather the information from various websites, such as [http://en.wikipedia.org Wikipedia], [http://www.allmusic.com All Music Guide], [http://musicbrainz.org/ MusicBrainz] or even [http://www.amazon.com Amazon.com].

&lt;lyrics&gt;I know, I know I've let you down
I've been a fool to myself
I thought that I could live for no one else
But now through all the hurt and pain
It's time for me to respect
The ones you love mean more than anything
So with sadness in my heart
Feel the best thing I could do
Is end it all and leave forever
what's done is done it feels so bad
what once was happy now is sad
I'll never love again my world is ending

I wish that I could turn back time
'Cause now the guilt is all mine
Can't live without the trust from those you love
I know we can't forget the past
You can't forget love and pride
Because of that, it's killing me inside

It all returns to nothing 
It all comes tumbling down, tumbling down, tumbling down
It all returns to nothing
I just keep letting me down, letting me down, letting me down

In my heart of hearts
I know that I could never love again
I've lost everything, everything
Everything that matters to me, matters in this world

I wish that I could turn back time
'Cause now the guilt is all mine
Can't live without the trust from those you love
I know we can't forget the past
You can't forget love and pride
Because of that it's killing me inside

It all returns to nothing 
it just keeps tumbling down, tumbling down, tumbling down
It all returns to nothing 
I just keep letting me down, letting me down, letting me down
It all returns to nothing 
it just keeps tumbling down, tumbling down, tumbling down
It all returns to nothing
I just keep letting me down, letting me down, letting me down 

Tumbling down, tumbling down, tumbling down
Letting me down, letting me down, letting me down
Tumbling down, tumbling down, tumbling down
Letting me down, letting me down, letting me down&lt;/lyrics&gt;

Is a particularly interesting considering it's supposed to come from Asuka.

*I've also found this song named as &quot;Turn Back Time&quot; in some mp3s, but that's also the name of a song from Cher I believe :?.


 The translation of the song name if I remember correctly is Come Sweet Death.  I could be mistaken

Nope, you're right, it's just me making typos as usual.</text>

&lt;lyrics&gt;When the Earth was still flat
And the clouds made of fire
And the mountains stretched up to the sky,
Sometimes Higher,
Folks roamed the earth
Like big rolling kegs
They had two sets of arms,
They had two sets of legs.
They had two faces pearing out of
One giant head so they could
Watch all around them
As they talked; while they read.
And they never knew nothing of love.
It was before the origin of love.

Now there was three sexes then;
One they looked like two men glued up back to back
They called the childen of the sun.
And similar in shape and girth was the children of the earth;
They looked like two girls rolled up in one.
And the children of the moon
Was like a fork shoved on a spoon;
They was part sun parth Earth
part daughter part sun.

Now the gods grew quite scared
Of our strength and defiance
And Thor said,
&quot;I'm gonna kill them all with my hammer
Like I killed the giants.&quot;
But Zeus said, &quot;No, you better let me
Use my lightning like scissors
Like I cut the legs off the whales
And dinosaurs into lizzards.&quot;
And then he grabbed up some bolts
And he let out a laugh
Said, &quot;I'll split 'em right down the middle
Gonna cut 'em right up in half.&quot;
And the storm clouds gathered above
Into great balls of fire.

And then fire shot down
From the sky in bolts
Like shining blade of a knife.
And it ripped right through the flesh
Of the children of the sun and the moon and the Earth
And some Indian god sewed the wound up to a hole,
Pulled it round to our belly to remind us of the price we paid.
And Osiris and the gods of the Nile gathered up a big storm
To blow a hurricane,
To scatter us away
In a flood of wind and rain
And a sea of tidal waves;
To wash us all away.
And if we don't behave
They'll cut us down again
And we'll be hopping 'round on one foot
And looking through one eye.

The last time I saw you
We'd just split in two.
You was lookin' and me,
I was lookin' at you.
You had a way so familiar
But I could not recognize
'Cause you had blood on your face;
I had blood in my eyes.
But I could swear by your expression
That the pain down in your soul
Was the same as the one down in mine.
That's the pain that cuts a straight line
Down through the heart;
We call it love.
We wrapped our arms around each other,
Tried to shove our selves back together
We was makin' love.
Makin' love.
It was a cold dark evening
Such a long time ago
When by the mighty hand of Jove;
It was a sad story how we became
Lonely two-legged creatures.
That's the story of the origin of love.
That's the origin of love.
The origin of love.
The origin of love.
The origin of love.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;!--Guest Vocals: Melanie Wills of [[One True Thing]]--&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Oh why can't I be what you need?
A new improved version of me.
But I'm nothing so good--No, I'm nothing;
Just bones and lonely ghosts burning down songs
Of violence, of love and of sorrow.
I beg for just one more tomorrow
Where you hold me down, fold me in,
Deep, deep, deep in the heart of your sins.

I break in two over you.
I break in two and each piece of me dies.
And only you can give the breath of life.
But you don't see me, you don't...

Here I'm inbetween darkness and light,
Bleached and blinded by these nights
Where I'm tossing and tortured 'till dawn by you,
Visions of you then you're gone.

The shock bleeds the red from my face
When I hear someone's taken my place.
How could love be so thoughtless, so cruel,
When all, all that I did was for you?

I break in two over you.
I break in two and each piece of me dies.
And only you can give the breath of life.
But you don't see me, you don't...

I break in two over you.
I break in two and each piece of me dies.
But only you can give the breath of life,
But you don't see me, you don't.

I break in two over you.
I break in two over you...
Over you...
I'd break in two.
I would break in two for you.

Now you see me; now you don't.
Now you need me; now you don't. &lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;It starts with one thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind that this rhyme is mine to explain in due time. 

All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away.

Its so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watching time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
We're wasting it all
Just to watch you go

I kept everything inside 
And even though I tried it all fell apart
What is meant to be will eventually be
A memory of a time

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I got too far
To lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter.

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind that this rhyme is mine
To remind myself how I tried so hard. 

In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far.  

Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me  

In the end
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried
It all fell apart
What is meant to be will eventually be
A memory of a time when..

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I got too far
To lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter.

I've put my trust
In you
I've pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I've put my trust
In you
I've pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know  

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I got too far
To lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;They are sick, they are poor
And they die by the thousands and we look away
They are wolves at the door
And they're not gonna move us or get in our way
'Cause we don't have the time
Here at the top of the world
Feeling all right
Here at the top of the world

We hold our own by keeping our hearts cold

Different God, darker skin
They are just not a burden that we'd like to bear
They are living in sin
There are so many reasons for us not to care
But I'm feeling all right
Here at the top of the world
Doing just fine
Here at the top of the world

We've learned money matter most
So we keep our cold selves close
Here at the top of the world
We hold our own
By keeping our hearts cold
And we've learned what matters most
So we keep our hearts cold

They are no one
They are no where
They are not our problem
Not worth saving
Nonexistent if we keep our hearts cold

They are no one
They are no where&lt;/lyrics&gt;

:''For a simple guide to adding song pages, see the [[Help:Quickstart#Adding_Songs_Quickly|Quickstart]] guide.''
{{notice|text=&lt;big&gt;Please skim [[Help:Standards|Lyriki's standards]] before reading this guide.&lt;/big&gt;}}

==Recommended Page Format==
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;Song
 | song     = '''''SongTitle'''''
 | artist   = '''''Artist'''''
 | album    = '''''Album'''''
 | year     = '''''AlbumYear'''''
 | credits  = '''''Composers'''''
 | lyricist = '''''Lyricist'''''
 }}
 
 &amp;lt;lyrics&amp;gt;'''''Lyrics line 1'''''
 '''''Lyrics line 2'''''
 '''''Lyrics line 3'''''
 '''''Lyrics line 4'''''&amp;lt;/lyrics&amp;gt;
 
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;C:Song|'''''SortLetter'''''|'''''SortTitle'''''}}

Simply fill in the appropriate information wherever there is a bold word in this template.
* '''Generally, use ''only one'' pair of lyrics tags''' &amp;mdash; more than one should be used for different versions or translations exclusively.&lt;br/&gt;''This is important since tools that extract information from the site rely on it''.
* Inside the lyrics tags you can't use the Wiki format modifiers. If you want to format the lyrics, use standard HTML tags instead.
* See the [[Help:Sorting|sorting help page]] for details on sorting issues and considerations.
* This template assumes the song is only on one album.
* If you do not know some of the information, leave it blank &amp;mdash; someone else will fill it in later. Blank parameters will help identify missing information to those editing the page in the future.
* If the album and artist pages are not already made, it would be very helpful to create them also!

==Songs On Multiple Albums==
If a song is present on multiple albums, the same template can be used as shown below.  An example page using this format can be found at [[The Beatles:Come Together]].

 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;Song
 | song     = '''''SongTitle'''''
 | artist   = '''''Artist'''''
 | albums   = &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;song album|'''''Artist'''''|'''''Album1'''''|'''''Album1Year'''''}}&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;song album|'''''Artist'''''|'''''Album2'''''|'''''Album2Year'''''}}
 | credits  = '''''Composers'''''
 | lyricist = '''''Lyricist'''''
 }}
 
 &amp;lt;lyrics&amp;gt;'''''Lyric line 1'''''
 '''''Lyric line 2'''''
 '''''Lyric line 3'''''
 '''''Lyric line 4'''''&amp;lt;/lyrics&amp;gt;
 
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;C:Song|'''''SortLetter'''''|'''''SortTitle'''''}}

Simply fill in the appropriate information wherever there is a bold word in this template.
* See the [[Help:Sorting|sorting help page]] for details on sorting issues and considerations.
* If you do not know some of the information, leave it blank &amp;mdash; someone else will fill it in later.

==Songs With Multiple Artists==
The same template can also be used to show a song with multiple artists.  An example page using this format can be found at [[John Parish &amp; Polly Jean Harvey:That Was My Veil]].

 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;Song
 | song     = '''''SongTitle'''''
 | artists  = &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;song artist|'''''Artist1'''''}} and &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;song artist|'''''Artist2'''''}}
 | albums   = &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;song album|'''''Artist1'''''|'''''Album'''''|'''''AlbumYear'''''}}
 | year     = '''''AlbumYear'''''
 | credits  = '''''Composers'''''
 | lyricist = '''''Lyricist'''''
 }}
 
 &amp;lt;lyrics&amp;gt;'''''Lyric line 1'''''
 '''''Lyric line 2'''''
 '''''Lyric line 3'''''
 '''''Lyric line 4'''''&amp;lt;/lyrics&amp;gt;
 
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;C:Song|'''''SortLetter'''''|'''''SortTitle'''''}}

Simply fill in the appropriate information wherever there is a bold word in this template.
* See the [[Help:Sorting|sorting help page]] for details on sorting issues and considerations.
* Note that when the song has multiple artists, you can't use the ''album''/''year'' parameters &amp;mdash; use the ''albums'' parameter instead with the ''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;song album}}'' template as in the previous section.
* If you do not know some of the information, leave it blank &amp;mdash; someone else will fill it in later.

 ==External Links==

 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;C:Artist|'''''SortLetter'''''|'''''SortName'''''}}

Simply fill in the appropriate information wherever there is a bold word in this template.
* Replace '''URL''' with the address of the artist's website, including the http:// or https:// part. If they don't have one, replace the line with '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{artist external links}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' (read more about this template on [[Template:artist external links|this page]]).
* See the [[Help:Sorting|sorting help page]] for details on sorting issues and considerations.
* If you are quoting biographic information from another source, be sure to attribute the source, preferably with a link.  Do not copy an entire entry from another site, even with an attribution.
* The albums should be listed in chronological order (by release date).
* Bands and groups have members.  These should be listed in alphabetical order by last name and followed by the years they were part of the group, if known.  Do not include the '''Member of''' entry for bands and groups.
* Artists may have been members of a band.  If they have strictly worked solo, don't include this entry.  The bands should be listed in chronological order, followed by the years the artist was part of the group, if known.  Do not include the '''Members''' entry for artists.
* Remember to include '''&lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''wiki-link brackets''']]''' around any band or artist reference.

You can look at [[Anberlin]], [[The Beatles]], [[Yes]], [[Yaz]] or [[Mark Lanegan]] as examples.

==Recommended Page Format==
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;Album
 | album    = '''''Album'''''
 | artist   = '''''Artist'''''
 | released = '''''Date'''''
 | tracks   =

 }}
 
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;C:Album|'''''SortLetter'''''|'''''SortTitle'''''}}

Simply fill in the appropriate information wherever there is a bold word in this template.
* See the [[Help:Sorting|sorting help page]] for details on sorting issues and considerations.
* Optionally, you may add the song lengths or other information as shown [[Template:Song link|here]].
* Please use an internationally acceptable '''Date''' format, such as '''February 16, 2005''', '''2005-02-16''' or '''16 February 2005'''.
* If you do not know some of the information, leave it blank &amp;mdash; someone else will fill it in later.

==Album Art==
To upload the album cover, just follow the link that appears once the '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;Album}}''' template has been filled (at least the '''artist''', '''album''' and '''released''' fields must have been provided).

We recommend that the image be between 250x250 and 500x500 pixels in size and in JPEG format.  See the ''[[Help:Adding New Albums#External Links|External Links]]'' section for some album art grabber sites.

===Special Cases===
In some cases, the link generated by the template can be of no use. For example, the template might generate a link to an invalid filename, or perhaps the file has already been uploaded to the site but with a different name or extension. In those cases, an additional parameter, '''image''', can be added to the '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;Album}}''' template indicating the name of the image file.

Whenever technically possible, the name of the file should follow the convention:
 AlbumArt-'''Artist'''-'''Album Name''' ('''Year''').'''Extension'''

Note that ''the above is not the name of the input file'' but the name the uploaded image will take once uploaded to the site (the input file's name doesn't matter, provided it shares the extension with the one entered).

For example, the file name for [[Pink Floyd:The Wall (1979)|Pink Floyd's The Wall]]'s cover art is [[:Image:AlbumArt-Pink Floyd-The Wall (1979).jpg|AlbumArt-Pink Floyd-The Wall (1979).jpg]].

==Various Artists==
To enter a compilation album or soundtrack that includes songs from multiple artists, follow the steps above, except use '''(Various Artists)''' as the artist name.  
* Be sure to include the parentheses, as there are bands actually named [[Various Artists]], [[V.A.]] and [[V/A]].  

When you list the songs, be sure to include the proper artist for that song.  The format should look like so:
 # &lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''Artist For Song''']]: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''Artist For Song''':'''Song Title'''|'''Song Title''']]

* You can view an example on the page for [[(Various Artists):1969 (1988)|1969 (1988)]].

&lt;lyrics&gt;Let me go.
Let me go.
Let me seek the answers that I need to know.
Let me find a way.
Let me walk away
Through the Undertow.
Please let me go.

Let me fly.
Let me fly.
Let me rise against that blood-red velvet sky.
Let me chase it all,
Break my wings and fall,
Probably survive.
So let me fly.
Let me fly.

Let me run.
Let me run.
Let me ride the crest of chance into the sun.
You were always there
But you may lose me here,
Now love me if you dare
And let me run.

I'm alive and I am true to my heart now
I am I, but why must truth always make me die?

Let me break,
Let me bleed.
Let me tear myself apart;
I need to breathe
Let me lose my way,
Let me walk astray,
Maybe to proceed
Just let me bleed.

Let me drain,
Let me die.
Let me break the things I love;
I need to cry.
Let me burn it all,
Let me take my fall
Through the cleansing fire.
Now let me die.
Let me die.

Let me out...
Let me fade into that pitch black velvet night.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Listen to me now, you...
Listen to me now, you...
Do my words mean more to hear
When I am standing here
On a stage like all your silly idols do?

Open up your eyes, all...
Let your walls and grins fall.
Would your reach for something new
If the crowds were reaching too?
Are you close enough to taste the tears at all?

Your hate is but a worn out lover, sick and sear.
&quot;Rape me again&quot; you beg in pain, dear friend,
But hey, just don't stop;
The stillness makes me scared

Listen to my plain words.
That's all you'll get from me: Words.
The rest is up to you
Would you dare to let me through?
Are you brave enough to leave me in control?

You're all afraid

I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid of you
I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid anymore
I am a shipwreck swept ashore.

Life won't wash away your sins.
Life can't wash away your guilt.
Life will only make your conscience wilt!

Somewhere a child just died,
Yet another victim for man's endless strife.
The world could be better than this.
There are so many ways to leave a life.
Would you claim you live yours right?
Right?! No!
Take a stand,
The world is in your hand

I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid of you
I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid of you
I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid of you
I'm not afraid
We're just the same me and you.
The same me and you
Walk with me
I see myself in you&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Scarlet boots, the kiss of death
Patience and the end of it
Blended angels whisperered love
Countdown 'till it's gone for long
Velvet voices haunting slow
Darkened nooks with bright decor

Georgian femmes are gone for weeks
Southern belles in London sing

I'm staring down the Eppley gate
Two more days before the plane arrives
And you'll be standing here with your smile

I'm carving up the lobby seats
Pushing down the caffeine drinks
Checking the arrival screens for yours

A hundred feet above the landing
There's a girl gliding down
She's floating toward me now
Her sleeves are all stretching out
And the jet is following behind

London skids, a grinding halt
Last night left to spend apart
Your bags are packed, but now for home
Stories of the tour unfold
Your booking agent's broken nose
Butting heads with creeping dolts

Georgian femmes are gone for weeks
Southern belles in London sing

Southern belles in London sing&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Was it more than attraction
And a physical lust?
Her loins, my imagination,
That first inconceivable touch
That I was planning,
I mean wishing,
How embarassed I'd been
If you knew what I was thinking.

And whoa when it started
My first thought was love
And not just lust
Cause when I heard you speak I felt warm

In the evening I saw you;
You were warming the bass up,
Your hair covered your face up,
I was acting indifferent at the merch booth putting on makeup

We met up at a party
In a swamp on a yacht.
I spun the helm,
But we were docked.

I crossed my fingers
But I didn't beg,
'Cause I knew you knew;
'Cause I knew you knew I liked you.

I knew you knew I liked you.
I knew you knew it,
But I figured desperate guys
Never had a chance with you.

I figured desperate guys
Never had a chance with you.

Close to you, Wishing 
We're conjoined at the tongue
Can you hear me thinking
I should stop?

I crossed my fingers
But... I didn't beg,
'Cause I knew you knew,
'Cause I knew you knew I liked you.

I knew you knew I liked you.
I knew you knew it,
But I figured desperate guys
Never had a chance.

I knew you knew I liked you.
I knew you knew it,
But I figured desperate guys
Never had a chance with you.
I figured desperate guys
Never had a chance with you.
I knew that desperate guys
Would never had a chance with you.

[distorted]
I knew you knew I liked you.
I knew you knew it.
I knew you knew I liked you.
I knew you knew it.
I knew you knew I liked you.
I knew you knew it.
I knew you knew I liked you.
I knew you knew it.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;[Girl]
Introverted boy
You are not interesting boy.
You think you're intellectual
But no one's talking to you now.

[Boy]
I might be an introvert to you
the shallow fashionista
Deep as any paper plate,
Dressed just like the girl beside you.

How could I forget a waste of cloth?
Of course I do remember;
On the back deck drunk and awkward
I think we accidentally met.

[Girl]
I know you've got some place to get to
And I've really gotta get somewhere.
Remember when I said that Vincent
Had some tickets for me there?
Yeah

[Boy]
How could I forget a waste of breath?
Of course, I do remember.
All the things you said were pointless;
Now you go on dropping names.

mmm... but I kind of dig you.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Disappear
I lost control
My body's moving
All on its own.
I watch myself
Walk away.
A foreign spirit
Too my place.

And he's there
Inside the door,
So my exit is riding my pulse.
Burst of black,
Breath of smoke.
I disappear,
I lost control.

I,
I disappear
I disappear
I disappear

I disappear
I lost control
My body's moving
All on it's own.
I watch myself
Walk away,
A foreign spirit
Took my place.

I,
I disappear
I disappear
I disappear

How could I resist?
It's all I've wanted,
Now I guess I've got it.
Why it had been back, don't know,
I hope this doesn't last forever.

I disappear
I disappear
I disappear
I disappear&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;It's a scene from the movie
It's an aisle at the store
It's the view of a canyon
The sound of a sword

It's an orchard peaches
Your wife in the shower
While you wait for appointments
Or as you walk through the park

Oh
Oh oh
Erection

You know it's not only love dear
That can flip the switch up
You know it probably should be
Maybe god fucked it up?

Oh
Oh oh
Erection

It boiled up like a tower
A monument in the park
It's the cock of a rifle
A memory in the dark

You tried to keep it a secret
But now the world's gonna know
You tried for perfection.

But then oh
Oh oh
Erection

Oh
Oh oh
Erection&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;The news has got me paranoid
Papers and the news reports
Casualties of every war
Anchor people keeping score
The weapons now are chemicals
In water and in edibles
Circulating envelopes
With powder through the postal routes

The threat of a disease is here
We nipped it once without a cure
It took forever 'til it stopped
With mandatory needle shots
They gave us all a little dose
Teach our bodies how to cope
Finally when we had it licked
Some terrorists are back with it

The propaganda's working now
I'm falling for it hook and reel
I'm stocking up on medicine
Buying tape to seal ourselves in

Paranoia! Paranoia! Paranoia! Paranoia!
Paranoia! Paranoia! Paranoia! Paranoia!
Paranoia! Paranoia! Paranoia! Paranoia!

Paranoiattack
Paranoia war
Paranoia seems like a bomb

Paranoia threat
Paranoia fact
Paranoia drops bombs
Bombs

Paranoia&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I've seen you a while now
Long enought to be close
There's some things about you
That I should know
I still don't

With all the questions we didn't ask
Our conversations could never last
Our moments alone were scarce and few
It was just easier to hide the truth

If all of our secrets were exposed
Would we be sharing the same bed?
I thought if I broke the silence first
Could I hear what you're thinking in your head?

I need to be talked to
I need to be touched
I need you to hold me
I need to feel loved

If I could open up to you
Maybe I could open you up

But instead I got the phone call:
&quot;Just thought I'd call to let you know
I wanna be alone all night again.&quot;

Phone call:
&quot;Just thought I'd call to let you know
I wanna be alone all night again.&quot;

With all of the questions we didn't ask
Our conversations could never last.

I need to be talked to
I need to be touched
I need you to hold me
I need to be feel loved

And if I could open up to you
Maybe you could open up to me
We do all the things that lovers do
I've been meaning to tell you how I feel

But instead I got the phone call:
&quot;Just thought I'd call to let you know
I wanna be alone all night again.&quot;

Phone call:
&quot;Just thought I'd call to let you know
I wanna be alone all night again.&quot;&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Don't admint you're sick
Let your fit body bury it
The faintness that you feel is nothing permanent
Don't buy the sickness on T.V.
You want your health, they want the fee
You see the adds and start to think, &quot;i feel it coming on.&quot;

No, no target market television
Telephonevangelism
Symptom finger
I'm gonna shut it off
Gonna down all the power
I'm a doctor today
I'm curing viewers by thousands

Don't admit you're sick
Let your fit body bury it
The faintness that you feel is nothing permanent
You open up and let them in
It's nothing conscious
What is this?
I feel a burning in my eye
It's from the television lights

Slow, slow it down, wait, now decide
Okay, i'm gonna shut it off
Down all the power
I'm a doctor today
I'm curing viewers by thousands

Don't admit you're sick
Let your fit body bury it
The faintness that you feel is nothing permanent
Do you have to get the shit they sell?
The pills that fix the way you feel
Now that they've shown you what to get
You feel it coming on

Low, low, lowdown high paid
Primetime capsule maker
Sickness lover
I'm gonna shut if off
Down all the power
Im a doctor today
I'm curing viewers by thousands&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;In the beginning there was semen
In a deep mouth of flesh.
At the crest I travelled
On a wave of virile mass.

Through a tunnel of mucus
And on toward a vault
With tourists and traffic
I just paced myself.

Not &quot;I&quot; as my whole self,
Just the half that I had
Before greeting the rest
Of my better half.

A connection was made
Through the shared love of science
And vows were taken;
A seed was hired.

A cavern of fluid
Brought shape to my hide
In the months that remained
'Til the time of my life.

I thrashed for the reason
Of spilling from the crack
To the palms of the doctor;
To a towel full of scraps.

My brains wouldn't fit
Through her organ of sex.
An incision was made
With a scalpel and masks.

I should have noticed the beauty
And not how it hurt,
Wet like a cherry
In the bloodbath of birth.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;You can follow logic
Or contest it all
The work solution makes
The common house a home

The element of progress
That you mention's gone
It de-evolved to something
You were headed toward

As I lay to die
The things I think
&quot;Did I waste my time?&quot;
I think I did
I worked for life

All I want are just pretty little homes
Our work makes pretty little homes

Like a cast shadow
Like a father's dream
Have a cut-out sun
What's a worse disease?
To get that pretty little home

As I lay to die
The things I think,
&quot;I don't wanna regret what I did
And work for life&quot;

All I want are just pretty little homes
Our work makes pretty little homes
Agenda suicide: the drones work hard before they die
And give up on pretty little homes

Like a cast shadow

Our work makes pretty little homes
Our work makes pretty little homes
Agenda suicide: the drones work hard before they die

&lt;lyrics&gt;Generals gathered in their masses
Just like witches at black masses
Evil minds that plot destruction
Sorcerer of death's construction

In the fields are bodies burning
As the war machine keeps turning
Death and hatred to mankind
Poisoning their brainwashed minds

Oh Lord, Yeah!


Politicians hide themselves away
They only started the war
Why should they go out to fight?
They leave that all to the poor

Yeah!

Time will tell on their power minds
Making war just for fun
Treating people just like pawns in chess
Wait 'til the judgement day comes

Yeah!


Now in darkness world stops turning
Ashes where the bodies burning
No more war pigs have the power
Hand of god has struck the hour

Day of judgement god is calling
On their knees the war pigs crawling
Begging mercy for their sins
Satan laughing spreads his wings

Oh Lord Yeah!&lt;/lyrics&gt;

==Original Lyrics==
''(Previous to the release of the &quot;Paranoid&quot; album)''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;lyrics&gt;Witches gather at black masses
Bodies burning in red ashes
On the hill the church in ruins
It's a scene of evil doings

It's a place for all bad sinners 
Watch them eating dead rats' innards
I guess it's the same
Where ever you may go
                                                                                               
Oh Lord Yeah!

Carry banners which denounce the Lord
Watch me rocking in my grave
See them anoint my head with dead rat's blood
See them stick the steak through me

Oh!
 
Don't hold me back cause I just gotta go
They've got a hold of my soul now
Lord's got my brain instinct with blood obscene
Look in my eyes I'm there enough

Yeah!

On the scene a priest appears
Sinners falling at his knees
Satan sends out funeral pyre
Casts the priest into the fire

It's the place for all bad sinners
Watch them eating dead rats' innards
I guess it's the same 
Where ever you may go

Oh Lord Yeah!&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I am iron man!

Has he lost his mind?
Can he see or is he blind?
Can he walk at all,
Or if he moves will he fall?
Is he alive or dead?
Has he thoughts within his head?
We’ll just pass him there
Why should we even care?

He was turned to steel
In the great magnetic field
When he traveled time
For the future of mankind

Nobody wants him
He just stares at the world
Planning his vengeance
That he will soon unfold

Now the time is here
For iron man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave
Kills the people he once saved

Nobody wants him
They just turn their heads
Nobody helps him
Now he has his revenge

Heavy boots of lead
Fills his victims full of dread
Running as fast as they can
Iron man lives again!&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Goin' home late last night
Suddenly I got a fright
Yeah, I looked through a window and suprise what I saw:
A fairy with boots was dancin' with a dwarf
All right now!

Yeah, Fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
Yeah, I saw it, I saw it, I tell you no lies
Yeah, fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
I saw it, I saw it with my own two eyes
Ohh, right now!

Yeah, Fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
Yeah, I saw it, I saw it, I tell you no lies
Yeah, Fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
I saw it, I saw it with my own two eyes
Allright now!

So I went to the doctor to see what he would give me
He said, &quot;Son, son, you've gone too far
'Cause smokin' and trippin' is all that you do.&quot;

Yeahhhhhh!&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;What you gonna do?
Time's caught up with you
Now you wait your turn
You know there's no return

Take your written rules
You join the other fools
Turn to something new
Now it's killing you

First it was the bomb
Vietnam napalm
Disillusioning
You push the needle in

From life you escape
Reality's black drape
Colors in your mind
Satisfying time

Oh you, you know you must be blind
To do such things like this
To take the sweet that you don't know
You're giving death a kiss
Poor little fool now

Your mind is full of pleasure
Your body's looking ill
To you it's shallow leisure
So drop the acid pill
Don't stop to think now

You're having a good time baby
But that won't last
Your mind's all full of things
You're living too fast

Go out enjoy yourself
Don't bottle it in
You need someone to help you
Stick the needle in, yeah

Now you know the scene
Your skin starts turning green
Your eyes no longer see
Life's reality

Push the needle in
Face death's sickly grin
Holes are in your skin
Caused by deadly pin

Head starts spinning round
You fall down to the ground
Feel your body heave
Death's hands starts to weave

It's too late to turn
You don't want to learn
Price of life too high
Now you're gonna die!&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;[hook] 
yall been eatin long enough now stop being greedy 
let's keep it real partner give to the needy 
ribs is touchin so don't make me wait 
fuck around and i'm gon bite you and snatch the plate

i can flip that flow i can stick that ho 
i can get that dough you know i'm with that yo 
ain't a thing about this shit i can't do or haven't seen 
but when it gets dark it's like a nigga's havin dreams

all nightmares the light dares to desert me 
got me like everybody wants to hurt me 
paranoid so i strike out at whatever 
the closest thing to me's gon get it but never

will i kill i think death is wrong 
so i'ma keep holdin on til what's left is gone 
you can put that on my nigga boom 
these other rap cats will give a nigga room

but if it calls for me to force my way in the door 
headhuntin motherfuckers stay on the floor 
four four is what i get sick with 
four more now all this is liquid

[hook x2]

i thank the lord every day that i'm blessed with the gift 
i'm the best so unless you wanna rest with the stiff 
don't touch that ah-ah leave it alone 
when you walk past the dog house leave it a bone

dogs bite dogs fight dogs like 
scratch shake and ho all night 
so when ya hear the arf arf start runnin 
cuz when ya hear that arf arf i'm comin

but i don't like drama so i stay to myself 
keep focused with this rap shit and pray for the wealth 
i want the money gimme the honeys with big asses 
the most expensive champagne ya got in big glasses

i'm drunk so i'ma bash this head wide open 
beggin me to stop but at least he died hopin 
didn't get his wish now he's a dish for the pack 
two glowin red eyes everything else black

[hook x2]

when the sun is up the gun is up on the shelf 
and all the runners up are thankin me for they health 
hopin that they not around when it gets dark outside 
the sun's goin down ya hear the bark outside

locks off the cage gauge with the buck shots 
faggot you been lucky all day this where your luck stops 
one drops then another then another 
gun pops goin through you hit your mother

when does it all end i found a friend in a dog 
cuz fuckin with these cats'll send a friend to the morgue 
many questions no answers stress 
try to hold my head and remember that i'm blessed

with a curse and it gets worse as time goes by 
can't see straight cuz i'm so high 
why ask why when you know 
nigga when it's your time to go you go

[hook x4]&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;this is just a test yes i'm just testing 
to see if i can open your minds i'm suggesting 
things that they teachin in schools need to be questioned 
surely we willl all feel the wrath of our inventions 
look for an alternative lifestyle  
societal livin is quite wild not serene or mild 
funny how there seems to be no route of escape 
concrete is outnumbered by landscapes 
white walk and take a step from the tar to pasture 
look back and all my peers labeled me a bastard 
i tried to hide livin in the ways of a tribe 
but they said i wouldn't be safe outside 
they said you really wanna leave huh 
they put a hole in my femur then laughed at their leisure 
i cried what can i do to please ya 
they said consume or die so i chose neither 
so now they got me on the run  
along with chuck flav x griffin the s-one 
i'm about to let em know my thoughts weight megatons 
the end of the story soon come

this is a test four years into my quest 
to see if i can manifest data i ingest 
the physical needs rest i'm never caught sleepin 
my mind remains live and thoughts keep leapin 
jump out of my sleep and rub my eyes 
caught a piece of the sunrise power from the skies 
my hotel window displays avenues and alleyways 
of those who have lost their ways 
the streets are paved with razorblades 
notice the prints from bloody steps of vets and cadets 
and infants who have never even touched the ground yet 
cuddled in the arms of those with steel through their palms 
crucified livin their life through lies 
with a diploma so they claimin they wise 
and who am i 
a question lurkin in the back of our minds 
but can only be defined through time 
and few practice patience 
so to most of us most of these things won't make sense 
unless it's dollars and cents which gives rise to new elements 
weapons for the killing and the churches to repent 
but i am not a judge these are words from the sludge 
courtesy of shanks television and scuds 
super lovin c and casanova rudd 
the wind the earth enough course to blood&lt;/lyrics&gt;

[whispers]
Here we go...here we go...

[Gift of Gab] 
Back on the journey again, tool is the pad and pen
Cool is the fan as the wind, soothin' you after I send
True inter vision risen and driven while givin' you MY
Isms of intuition while niggaz is livin' a LIE
Syllables spill and I fly, high as a pittacle rhyme 
Not to belittle a fool, but try to get into you my -
Lyrics inherited form awareness somewhere in the sky
Clearly you'll give them merit and cherish 'em better wit' time
There is none ever and on like rivers, so clever I shine
Verbal ambassador travel in this endeavor of mine
Never a anti-gangster, the ghetto is still on the mind
If I was, not rappin', a nigga might be up inside
All of you terraces, stealin' wallets and necklaces, I 
give hella gratefulness for the blessin' share this and fly
Everywhere people outside the culture now try to deFINE
What it is, but it is MINE, such it is, love with BLIND
Vision but no division is vivid we livin' inside
Vicious vindictive and mental prisons from within the mind
I sit and find stillness from minutes is written the RHYME
Gettin' you smitten wit' it, particularly if you're a prime
Listener, listen up, twist it up like the lyrics was lime
Vintage is instant, so give it up when you hear it recited
Recite it at attention, relivin' tension and bendin' yo' spine
Sendin' you signals to get yo' internal system aligned
Lyrical pittacle, situation is critical 
Syllable after syllable, Give It To You, deliver you my -
Intervals, sendin' you through dimensions who didn't know
Hidden in you, within you, when you get in the begin into it
Sentiments internets, couldn't send you yet signals you get
Rippin' through skin and through tissue, fix you elixirs that MIGHT -
(lift your peripheral vision, the mystical wisdom that tends
to go into the infinite system of livin' and this is the ending 
As well as the beginning of the Gift and his prime)
Mission the bliss is divine, Christen it, isn't it fine?
Listen and dissin' it, that's the incident innocent
Men and women hit, lyrics is killin' niggaz, they shivelin'
The predicaments thick, and it spills the wig of the ignorant lyricist, puttin' fear in their spirit...
Yo, that's my time!

[record skips in fast forward]

[Intro to &quot;Side to Side&quot;]
I know all you fellas have had a lady in your life that, you really appreciated 
and you wanted to do something special for her and, let her know it
Well, I gotta lady like that, and I wrote this song to her...
&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Cuéntame que harás después que estrenes su cuerpo
Cuando muera tu traviesa curiosidad
Cuando memorices todos sus recovecos
Y decidas otra vez regresar
Ya no estaré aquí­ en el mismo lugar
Si no tiene más que un par de dedos de frente
Y descubres que no se lava bien los dientes
Si te quita los pocos centavos que tienes
Y luego te deja solo tal como quiere
Sí que volverás el dí­a
En que ella te haga trizas
Sin almohadas para llorar
Pero si te has decidido
Y no quieres más conmigo
Nada ahora puede importar
Porque sin ti
El mundo ya me da igual

Si te vas, si te vas, si te marchas
Mi cielo se hará gris
Si te vas, si te vas, ya no tienes
Que venir por mí
Si te vas, si te vas, y me cambias
Por esa bruja, pedazo de cuero
No vuelvas nunca más
Que no estarás aquí­

Toda escoba nueva siempre barre bien
Luego vas a ver desgastadas las cerdas cuando las
Arrugas le corten la piel
Y la celulitis invada sus piernas
Volverás desde tu infierno
Con el rabo entre los cuernos
Implorando una vez más
Pero para ese entonces
Yo estaré un millón de noches
Lejos de esta enorme ciudad
Lejos de ti
El mundo ya me da igual

Si te vas, si te vas, si te marchas
Mi cielo se hará gris
Si te vas, si te vas, ya no tienes
Que venir por mi
Si te vas, si te vas, y me cambias
Por esa bruja, pedazo de cuero
No vuelvas nunca más
Que no estaré aquí&lt;/lyrics&gt;

Tengo la camisa negra
Hoy mi amor esta de luto

Hoy tengo en el alma una pena
Y es por culpa de tu embrujo

Hoy sé que tú ya no me quieres
Y eso es lo que más me hiere
Que tengo la camisa negra
Y una pena que me duele
Mal parece que solo me quedé
Y fue pura todita tu mentira
Que maldita mala suerte la mí­a
Que aquel dí­a te encontré
Por beber del veneno malevo de tu amor
Yo quedé moribundo y lleno de dolor
Respiré de ese humo amargo de tu adiós
Y desde que tú te fuiste yo sólo tengo

Tengo la camisa negra
Porque negra tengo el alma
Yo por ti perdí­ la calma
Y casi pierdo hasta mi cama

Cama cama come on baby
Te digo con disimulo

Que tengo la camisa negra
Y debajo tengo el difunto
Tengo la camisa negra
Ya tu amor no me interesa
Lo que ayer me supo a gloria
Hoy me sabe a pura
Miércoles por la tarde y tú que no llegas
Ni siquiera muestras señas
Y yo con la camisa negra
Y tus maletas en la puerta
&lt;/lyrics&gt;

Hey! Do it now! Yeah, hey!

Yeah, once I was a boogie singer ... playin' in a rock &amp; roll band
I never had no problems, yeah ... burnin' down the one night stands
And everything around me, yeah ... got to start to feelin' so low
And I decided quickly [yes, I did] ... to disco down and check out the show

Yeah, they were dancin' and singin' and movin' to the groovin'
And just when it hit me somebody turned around and shouted

Play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music white boy
Lay down that boogie and play that funky music till you die ... 
(hey,hey) till you die ... yeah, yeah

Well, I tried to understand this ... Yeah, huh, I thought that they were out of their minds
How could I be so foolish, [How could I] ... tonight's the hours, the one behind
So still I kept on fightin' ... Wow, loosin' every step of the way (Yeah, what'd you do?)
I said, &quot;I must go back there&quot;[Got to go back] ... and check to see if things still the same

Yeah, they were dancin' and singin' and movin' to the groovin'
And just when it hit me somebody turned around and shouted

Play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music white boy
Lay down that boogie and play that funky music till you die ... 
Till you die ... (Yeah) Wow, till you die

(Come on ... Play some electrified funky music)

[Hey, wait a minute] Now first it wasn't easy ... changin' rock &amp; roll and minds
And things were getting shaky ... I thought I'd have to leave it behind
Oh, but now its so much better [It's so much better] ... I'm funkin out in ev-er-y way
But-I'll never lose that feelin' [No I won't] ... Of how I learned my lesson that day

When they were dancin' and singin' and movin' to the groovin'
And just when it hit me somebody turned around and shouted

Play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music white boy
Lay down that boogie and play that funky music till you die ... 
Till you die ... oh, till you die


(They shouted, Play that funky music) Play that funky music
(Play that funky music) Got to keep on ... Play that funky music
(Play that funky music) Pl--AY that funky music
(Play that funky music) Wanna take ya higha now ... 

Play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right, yeah

Play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right

Play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right, yeah 
&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Cop this...

I am hot
and when I'm not
I'm cold as ice
Get out my way
Just step aside
Or pay the price
What I want I take
What I don't I break
And I don't want you
With a flick of my knife
I could change your life
There's nothin' you can do

I'm a problem child
I'm a problem child (yes I am)
I'm a problem child
And I'm wild...

Make my stand
No man's land
On my own
Man in blue
It's up to you
The seed is sown
What I want I stash
What I don't I smash
And you're on my list
Dead or alive
I've got a .45
and I never miss

I'm a problem child
I'm a problem child
I'm a problem child
Just runnin' wild...

Just watch your step

Every night
Street light
I drink my booze
Some run
Some fight
But I win they lose
What I need I like
What I don't I fight
and I dont like you
Say bye bye
while you're still alive
Your time is through

I'm a problem child
I'm a problem child
I'm a problem child
I'm a problem child
I'm a problem child
I'm a problem child
Even my mother hates me
I'm a problem child

Problem child...&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;yo challengers get marked off like days on calendars
i hunt down frontin mc's just like a scavenger
focusin on those that's glamourous on camera
burning through they town like a double headed gamera
mmmm.. mc's a la deep fry
my style explodes just like the sky in the fourth of july
living independent days like will smith
motherfuck a gun i got these murderous rap styles to kill with
yo you could ask the people that i chill with
you could cut off akrobatik's legs and i'll be still swift
i can't be stopped by no physical ailment
fuck what accutrainer thought i suffer from derailment
third rail watts as i blow up spots
with styles that rock knots while your billboard spots
are full of wack stuff laced with mc's that bluff
when we know that they style's not rough enough

i dominate the earth like poverty and hunger
wisdom of a century but eighty years younger
so through youthful expression there's no need for second guessing
first album makes a lasting impression
tighter than the skirt that's on the hookers you be stressin
i master studio stage and freestyle sessions
blessin rap fiends with art that's dead heat
watch me freakin like moses and park this red seat
bloody streets corny mc's and muddy beats
the flow's so dirty when i sleep i get money sheets
my lyrics meet and surpass expectations
all real mc's bond that's where nations
are corny mc's who grab mics and bluff
when we know that they style's not ruff enuff

now the handwritin on the wall is plain
that mr akrobatik was put here to reign 
reign like alexander droppin flows on innocent bystanders
futuristic seas like highlander
live and black to white like a panda
from boston to atlanta why mc's reach for mylanta
cuz i'm all up in your gasterix but wait there's a asterix
i'm also in your favorite dj mastermix
yo pass the kicks and snares kid i'm famished
i brought sense to the battle mc's vanished
one day i'ma ask fat joe to teach me spanish
so i could tell rappers in two languages that they banished
i keep it locked like nuns hold they legs tight
and bring chaos like a halloween night egg fight
damn skippy rock that peter pan ? or jif
crunch you like peanuts i'm butter with the gift
my style is swift like jonathon you're corny like mocassins
and ain't no rap arena you could rock this in
my coalition rocks the due awareness solo mission
picture hip-hop the indy five i got the pole position
i'm up a level like a cd rom
plus my self produced tracks be the bomb and i'm gone
because we know that your style's not ruff enuff&lt;/lyrics&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15550">==Lyrics extension==
This is a suggestion to the admins of this site:

I'd like to make a suggestion for a third way to enter music lyrics. You can create a simple [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Write_your_own_MediaWiki_extension extension] to mediawiki that will handle all of the line breaks.

For example this is a sample script I wrote. If you to save it as lyrics.php under the Extensions folder 
&lt;pre&gt;

&lt;?php
#
# lyrics extension by bailey
#
$wgExtensionFunctions[] = &quot;lyrics&quot;;

function lyrics() {
   global $wgParser;
   $wgParser-&gt;setHook( &quot;lyrics&quot;, &quot;parse&quot; );
}
 
# The callback function for converting the input text to HTML output
function parse( $input, $argv ) {
   return preg_replace(&quot;[\r\n|\n]&quot;, &quot;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;, $input);
}
?&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
and then add the following to the end of your LocalSetting.php
 include(&quot;extensions/lyrics.php&quot;);

You would then be able to type in all of your lyrics with just one tag
 &lt;lyrics&gt;
 It's four in the morning, the end of December
 I'm writing you now just to see if you're better
 New York is cold, but I like where I'm living
 There's music on Clinton Street all through the evening.
 &lt;/lyrics&gt;

and the breaks would be automatically added. Of course with this technique you couldn't add wikilinks to the middle of songs but I think the trade off is worth it compared to having to sit there and add either a space at the begining or a br tag at the end.

==Thanks for the above suggestion==
Just a quick thank you to whoever made that suggestion, I believe it was Bailey :)... I read again and it has Bailey's name in the script, I'm so smurt. x.X;;;

==Stubs==

Anyone familiar with [http://en.wikipedia.org Wikipedia] is likely to know about stubs. For those that don't, a stub is a page that has just been started and needs work.  It seems like we could use something like this. [[User:Olleicua|Olleicua]] 16:48, 8 August 2006 (PDT)

:what would be a stub though?  If there is lyrics/a song I listen to that clearly needs &quot;work&quot; then I usually would just add &lt;pre&gt;{{cleanup}}&lt;/pre&gt; to the page.--[[User:Ahoier|ahoier]] 06:10, 10 August 2006 (PDT)

::Not for pages that need cleaning. For pages that are unfinished.  Like an artist page with only one album and two songs.  Then someone could go to the stubs category and see that an artist they knew was there and add to it. [[User:Olleicua|Olleicua]] 16:42, 15 August 2006 (PDT)

:::We already have &lt;nowiki&gt;{{incomplete}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template for such pages. --[[User:Pietaster|Pietaster]] 23:55, 15 August 2006 (PDT)


==Images==

I'm having difficulty getting images to work with the Album Template.  An example is here: [[A Perfect Circle:Thirteenth Step (2003)]].

==Chords==
It would be good to add chods to lyrics and have a chords site cheers
&lt;small&gt;(comment belongs to [[User:Derekmarks|Derekmarks]])&lt;/small&gt;
:This site is a lyrics destination, not chords. While I agree a tablature/chords wiki would be excellent, this is not the place for it, since there are many different ways to interpret a song. --[[User:Suspchaos|Suspchaos]] 03:33, 30 September 2006 (PDT)

==External Links==

Could I suggest replacing the link to discogs with one to www.rateyourmusic.com? Discogs is terrible - for instance, I just added Ryan Adams's album Heartbreaker here, and Discogs doesn't even list it in Adams's discography! RYM has more contributors and a more thorough database. --[[User:Waitingtoderail|Waitingtoderail]] 14:04, 19 November 2006 (EST)
:Why &quot;replace&quot; it, perhaps just add another external links entry?  Dunno, never been to rateyourmusic.com --ahoier 12:55, 19 November 2006 (PST)
Well, either-or. --[[User:Waitingtoderail|Waitingtoderail]] 19:45, 19 November 2006 (EST)

:I'm all for minimalism: remove Discogs and the Google link and add nothing. :P  No one should need more than allmusic.com and Wikipedia. --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 19:54, 19 November 2006 (PST)

Allmusic often has incorrect album data. [[User:Waitingtoderail|Waitingtoderail]] 07:05, 20 November 2006 (EST)

:How would folks feel about adding links to [http://wikevent.org Wikevent] for active artists? -- [[User:Mark|Mark]] 01:43, 2 January 2007 (PST)

==Non-Latin characters==
If the artist in question produces albums or song names that don't use Latin letters (for example Chinese or Arabic), should the articles be put in Latin letters with the original Chinese/Arabic/whatever in clarification in the main article itself.. or should the article title go with the original with the Latin in clarification? [[User:Matsu|Matsu]] 09:30, 26 November 2006 (PST)
:'Kay.. guessing not.. I get a wiki SQL error-type thing when I try. &gt;_&lt; Though it'd be lovely to fix that. [[User:Matsu|Matsu]] 09:32, 26 November 2006 (PST)

==flag lyrics as &quot;official&quot;==
I'd like to suggest a way to flag lyrics as being official, like if they were taken directly from the CD cover slip, or from the artist's  website or something like that. Because sometimes a song's lyrics sound like one thing, but the listed lyrics say it's something else. It'd be nice to know if the lyrics were made by a user who guessed the lyrics (in which case they would be edited) or if they are the real lyrics (in which case they would not be edited). --[[User:Qhiiyr|qhiiyr]] 10:30, 7 January 2007 (PST)

:I'm not sure what you mean... Are you implying that the lyrics found on cd covers are the &quot;real&quot; ones? If so, I'd have to say I disagree, as sometimes they also have mistakes. This will introduce an irrelevant separation between official and unofficial lyrics since we don't strive for &quot;official&quot; lyrics but for accuracy. --[[User:Attendant|Attendant]] 10:57, 7 January 2007 (PST)

::Really? I'd think that the lyrics put out by the artists themselves would be correct...why wouldn't they be? Are we talking about the same thing? --[[User:Qhiiyr|qhiiyr]] 12:26, 7 January 2007 (PST)

:::As to why CD covers and alike could have the wrong lyrics, there can be lots of reasons. For instance, sometimes they omit certain lines or use simplifications such as ''chorus'' even though some lines may change each time the ''chorus'' repeats. I do believe however that, generally, they are a pretty good source; it's just that they don't have the final word.
:::Now, exactly what makes you think the lyrics you find in a CD cover or an artist site were put there by the ''artists'' themselves? --[[User:Attendant|Attendant]] 14:04, 7 January 2007 (PST)

== Favicon ==

So, even though favicons are a MS invention I still think they're pretty neat to have, so I made this one.

[[Image:Proposed lyriki favicon.png]]

I'm planning on putting little icons next to the &quot;Other Sites&quot; links on Wikevent as well, so whatever gets adopted here, I'll use there as well. -- [[User:Mark|Mark]] 05:29, 2 February 2007 (PST)

:Nice, but can the note have the little flag on it? --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 12:06, 4 February 2007 (PST)

::♪ instead of ♩? (eighth note instead of a quarter note) --[[User:Dhraakellian|Dhraakellian]] 16:04, 4 February 2007 (PST)
:::I don't see why not.  I guess it makes sense since they're all eighth notes in the logo -- [[User:Mark|Mark]] 03:10, 5 February 2007 (PST)
:::Here you go: [[Image:Proposed_lyriki_favicon_eitghth_note.png]].  I still think I like the quarter note version better though: it's a bit cleaner, and for a very small favicon I think that's important. -- [[User:Mark|Mark]] 03:26, 5 February 2007 (PST)

::::I guess it doesn't really make a difference to me, I didn't have any non-eighth notes available when I was making the logo. :P  Anyhow, [[User:Evelyn|Evelyn]] gets the final say, so you should poke her about it. :) --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 14:48, 5 February 2007 (PST)

:::::I went with the eigth-note version, since it looked closer to the main icon we have.  Thank you for making that! --[[User:Evelyn|Evelyn]] 14:53, 8 February 2007 (PST)

::::::You're welcome! -- [[User:Mark|Mark]] 02:59, 12 February 2007 (PST)

== Improvement of Lyriki site ==

Well, I have contributed some lyrics which are not in English, so I have two suggestions for admins and those who keep the site running.

[1] There could be better way for organization of translations, in a separate file, now I have inserted the enlish text below the original song

[2] Maybe the site may allow for embedding of YouTube videos. So if there is currently a YouTube song/clip/video of the song, it can be embedded somewhere in the lyrics page. It will be nice.

Just suggestions, I think none of them will violate any copyright because YouTube offers this service for embedding, and also English translations of famous songs will be nice to be here, because if you have a favourite song you also want to know the meaning of the text. :-)

==Categories==

Any concerns with adding artist name categories, and perhaps year the song was recorded?  [[User:Chadlupkes|Chadlupkes]] 20:12, 10 November 2007 (PST)
:I'm not opposed... artist categories should be fairly simple -- it would just be added to the song page templates. --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 12:48, 11 November 2007 (PST)
:In fact, I think artist categories would be a good replacement for long-discography artist pages. --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 18:06, 11 November 2007 (PST)
::Sounds like an interesting idea for automation of such things.  &lt;s&gt;How would external links to wiki/musicbrainz/etc for artists (as opposed to their individual albums) be handled though?&lt;/s&gt; --[[User:Dhraakellian|Dhraakellian]] 18:25, 11 November 2007 (PST)
:::Question withdrawn... I obviously haven't been doing much wiki stuff recently. --[[User:Dhraakellian|Dhraakellian]] 18:37, 11 November 2007 (PST)
::I'm afraid i don't understead how artist categories could possibly replace the artis pages with the discography, and on the other hand, what's about [http://www.lyriki.com/Category:Artists] so catecories for artists seem to be already done.--[[User:Knufaz|Knufaz]] 02:43, 12 November 2007 (PST)

==Page names==

Hi, i got an problem with some page name. At the time i work around the discography of the Band Crosby, Stills, Nash&amp; Young. You see there is an ampersand contained in the name.
The Artist Page and two Album pages work quite fine:
[[Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash]], [[Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young:Déjà Vu (1970)]], [[Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young:Four Way Street (1971)]]
When i now look at the page name which ist given when i click on &quot;move&quot; the page there is a &quot;/Crosby, Stills&quot; added for &quot;Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash&quot; so its: &quot;Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash/Crosby, Stills&quot; The Same for &quot;.... &amp; Young&quot; and the two given albums.

Why is that?

But for the Band without &quot;Young&quot;, so for Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash i got a problem:
The link to thier selftitled Album &quot;Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash (1969)&quot; won't work ([[Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash:Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash (1969)]]
Even when i added the &quot;/Crosby, Stills&quot; to the page name in still won't work. But it does with the two other given albums of Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young.

Any ideas about this?

Kind regards
--[[User:Knufaz|Knufaz]] 01:03, 14 November 2007 (PST)--

==Lyriki2tex==

Hi, I have written a script that downloads pages from Lyriki and generates a LaTeX file from them. I didn't find any policy here neither allowing nor forbidding it. Maybe there could be a link under &quot;Lyriki Plug-ins&quot; in the main page for it? Here's the link to a page describing it:

I think we should have featured album/artist/song/lyrics or, album/artist/song/lyrics of the week or something so that this site would look more pleasing for readers. [[User:La Super Thalía Fan|La Super Thalía Fan]] 18:43, 20 April 2008 (PDT)


==Mass conversion from other Lyric sites==
Hello there! I would really like to appreciate a script to mass import lyrics from other sites such as lryiciwki. They have pretty similar wiki-code and partially more complete Artists. Someone can write this? I don't know which language to use best yet. Amarok lyrics script uses '''Ruby''' for example. Mass submitting on our wiki could be easily done with '''WikipediaFS''', a fuse-based file system to manage Mediawiki content.

I hope you guys don't get this wrongly. This is not intend to ''steal'' content from other site but to ''save'' loads of time :-)
--[[User:Lenzoid|Lenzoid]] 23:39, 28 July 2008 (UTC)

:The &quot;Amarok&quot; script could handle that just fine. However, I don't think we want to do such a massive import of content. Also, attempting to do it would probably just kill the server. --[[User:Attendant|Attendant]] 04:02, 29 July 2008 (UTC)

::Hi, thanks for your quick answer, Attendant. But I don't understand why this would 'kill the server'. I didn't mean to convert all the content at once but to convert only special complete stuff like for example an complete Artist page like that of [http://lyricwiki.org/Cannibal_Corpse Cannibal Corpse]. The script could therefore parse the Page for links and download only the content of the linked pages. Having that content downloaded, they could then be submitted with one hit by WikiFS. I've tested it with uploading ~20 of files at once. It waits for each file to be completed and then proceeds to the next. Since it took about a minute to submit these files I think the server wouldn't collapse while submitting the new content. --[[User:Lenzoid|Lenzoid]] 11:30, 29 July 2008 (UTC)

==aboutus.com lyriki entry==
Hi,

today i asked google for &quot;lyriki&quot; and found an entry on www.aboutus.com. Can anybody explain the description on that page concerning lyriki.com? Was this manipulated or is that our &quot;official&quot; external description of this project?
Here you find the entry im referring to: [http://www.aboutus.org/Lyriki.com Lyriki on aboutus.com]

== API Integration ==
Hey,

With the a large portion of the Linux population using GNOME and choosing not to run amarok, I have made a lyrics script to integrate with lyriki.com.

It is still a work in progress, but it seems that the part of the program that update the site is being redirected to [[Api.php]]...  I was wondering if there was any plan to look at the API and make it fully functional again? (It is not my script, I have tested it against several other wiki sites).  I hope this isn't taken the wrong way, I personally love lyriki over all the other lyrics sites, I am just trying to help out :)

Thanks, --[[User:3321thec|3321thec]] 04:12, 24 August 2010 (UTC)</text>

If we come up with something better, we'll be sure to edit it up, but, I applaud the initiative :)

Lately I've been busy with some RL going on.  My mum's had her second leg amputated and is in the nursing home, just trying to manage through that and haven't had much time to manage this place like I'd like too.

Also, if you'd like, please sign up for an acocunt, just makes it easier to know who's really who ;)

[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 10:35, 19 Dec 2005 (PST)
Thanks, I'll sign up :)

I've realised that categories aren't the best way to do it as it makes it ever more cluttered. I saw someone else had created an &quot;Artist:Q&quot; page that had a list of artists with Q, which then linked to their songs/lyrics. Seems like a great way to implement the organisation, so I'll get on doing that.

I hope your mother gets better :)

Edit: I have signed up as &quot;268229&quot;. Please see the Queen page and tell me if that's how you would prefer the organization. I believe it's much better than having individual pages for albums, people could also upload album covers and put them with their albums. Now all we need are lyrics =P</text>

Time after time
I've done my sentence
But committed no crime
And bad mistakes
I've made a few
I've had my share of sand
Kicked in my face
But I've come through

And we mean to go on and on and on and on

We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting
Till the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
Cause we are the champions of the world

I've taken my bows
And my curtain calls
You brought me fame and fortune
And everything that goes with it
I thank you all
But it's been no bed of roses
No pleasure cruise
I consider it a challenge before
The whole human race
And I ain't gonna lose

And we mean to go on and on and on and on

We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting
Till the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
Cause we are the champions of the world

We are the champions - my friends
And we'll keep on fighting
Till the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
Cause we are the champions&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Ooh, let's go
Steve walks warily down the street
With the brim pulled way down low
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet
Machine guns ready to go

Are you ready, hey, are you ready for this
Are you hangin' on the edge of your seat
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat - yeah

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone and another one gone
Another one bites the dust, eh
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust

How do you think I'm going to get along
Without you when you're gone
You took me for everything that I had
And kicked me out on my own

Are you happy? Are you satisfied?
How long can you stand the heat
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat
Look out

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust

And bring him to the ground
You can beat him
You can cheat him
You can treat him bad and leave him
When he's down, yeah
But I'm ready, yes I'm ready for you
I'm standing on my own two feet
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
Repeating to the sound of the beat
Oh yeah

Another one bites the dust
And another one gone and another one gone
Another one bites the dust, yeah
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust
Shoot out
Hey, alright&lt;/lyrics&gt;

I really need to remember to sign in when I make my edits and such.

Anyways!  The queen discography looks rather nice, the only caveat that crosses my mind is that if it were to resemble the entry I made with album art for Audioslave, that it would be a bit hectic for 56k modem users to load.  It's only a minor consideration, just something that stumbled into my brain as I was trying to imagine editing the album art in for each album ;)  Admittedly, it'd look very pretty.  I just might wonder if doing seperate albums whilst having more pages to maintain might still be better?

Looking forward to hearing back from you.

== Old vs New ==

I get what you mean.  Really, the thing is, I'm correcting one thing, then I see the other thing needs updated as well, so I do that.  But, for 2pac for example, there's no way I can update them all, but I'd have a really hard time leaving that one as is.  I'll try.

More importantly, I'm curious as to why you like the old format vs. the new?  I mean, I know that people have preferences in the album/discography, but why the lyrics page?

The biggest thing I think that templates have going for them is that, if we decided to change the format, add color, change fonts, etc., the templates set us up for doing that across the board, quickly.

In any case, let me know so I can stop updating 'em if you want me to.
Seeya,
Peter

{{song
| artist = (Various Artists)

:I like the older format because it looks more like it &quot;belongs&quot; there (in its own habitat xD); it just sits at the top nicely instead of being placed in the middle of nowhere, inside the actual lyrics, etc. plus the old format allows for more information without the need for something to be expanded. Eg. compare the [http://www.lyriki.com/index.php?title=%28Various_Artists%29:Hip_Hop_For_Respect_%282000%29:One_Four_Love_Pt._1 old format] against the new format (to the right), it just doesn't work with this type of song (probably bad example, couldn't think of anything else with many artists)
:I don't know if you can list multiple artists, but if you could, it just wouldn't suit the style of the site and look completely weird. Also the old format is much easier to make, any person could do it, with SSong, I have pretty much no idea what I'm doing xD SSong was a great (unique) idea, but it just doesn't seem like it was pulled off right - it's just not flexible enough to meet the demands of some of the more complex songs (and still look good/natural).
:I do agree about the usage of templates though (the color, format, etc. part), I would just like to see it done nicer
:I hope you know what I mean, I suck at explaining things (Is this even the right way of answering a wiki reply thing?) XD--[[User:268229|268229]] 23:36, 22 March 2006 (PST)
:Update, I found a good example of how obtrusive that template can be: [http://www.lyriki.com/index.php?title=The_Mighty_Mighty_Bosstones:Someday_I_Suppose&amp;rcid=15694 The Mighty Mighty Bosstones:Someday I Suppose], in my opinion, nothing should interfere with the actual lyrics :\--[[User:268229|268229]] 16:45, 25 March 2006 (PST)
::What do you find obtrusive about the &quot;Someday I Suppose&quot; example?  It seems perfectly fine to me... in fact in interferes less with the lyrics than the style you keep using (and which will have to be redone by someone else).  It just seems like you're putting in a helluva lot of wasted effort at pushing the old style on everything.
:::It got fixed quickly, but if you check the version of which I was referring to [http://www.lyriki.com/index.php?title=The_Mighty_Mighty_Bosstones:Someday_I_Suppose&amp;oldid=18426] you'll see what I mean :) By obtrusive I mean the new format is actually inside the lyrics area and I feel that nothing should remotely interfere with the lyrics, the old format at least sat the top in its own section and could in no way interfere with the actual lyrics. I've got an arguement of pros and cons for both format somewhere on my PC if you're interested. I don't see it as wasted effort anyway ;) Thanks for dropping by. --[[User:268229|268229]] 23:34, 30 May 2006 (PDT)
::the [http://www.lyriki.com/index.php?title=The_Mighty_Mighty_Bosstones:Someday_I_Suppose&amp;oldid=18426 old version] does look very weird, though with the line breaks at [http://www.lyriki.com/index.php?title=The_Mighty_Mighty_Bosstones:Someday_I_Suppose&amp;rcid=15694 the newer page] it looks a lot nicer.  I like that there's a strict distinction between where the lyrics start, and where the extraneous content (the album/artist information) is.  that it's set away in the other half of the page.  With the &quot;new&quot; format, both the lyrics and information start at the top of the page, and it's all easy to find. --[[User:Ahoier|ahoier]] 15:56, 31 May 2006 (PDT)

== Bots ==

Hey, you mentioned getting/making a bot.  Do you have any suggestions on how to start here?  I'm pretty good with Java and could get something set up there pretty easily.  Any ideas?  Thanks --[[User:Risser|risser]] 18:38, 22 March 2006 (PST)
:I don't know anything on making bots, you should probably see [[User:Bailey]] (who made the lyrics extension) or somebody else who knows this stuff, better yet, steal some experienced bot maker from wikipedia ;P A bot would save you a hell of a lot of time converting the pages--[[User:268229|268229]] 23:39, 22 March 2006 (PST)

== Space or no space ==
I just wanted to know about the moving of the Warning: album by Green Day from

http://www.lyriki.com/index.php?title=Green_Day:_Warning:_%282000%29

to

http://www.lyriki.com/index.php?title=Green_Day:Warning:_%282000%29

We need to set a standard: either space between artist and album, or no space.
Also, if you delete that page then the redirect you put there won't work. Instead, I suggest moving the page? 
All the other links in the Green Day section are like that; should they all be moved to the correct format?[[User:Bioarchie1234|Bioarchie1234]] 06:44, 16 April 2006 (PDT)
:I see what you mean, The [http://www.lyriki.com/index.php?title=Help:Adding_New_Albums correct format] is without the space, I guess the original creator of the artist page didn't know. I'll go fix it all now, thanks for addressing this issue :) --[[User:268229|268229]] 16:02, 16 April 2006 (PDT)

:How long do you reckon it will take for the administrators to get round to deleting the incorrect pages (e.g ones with a space before the album title)? There's one for Warning:, and one for American Idiot. If you click on the link, then add an underscore before the title, you get redirected back to the page without an underscore. However, if you follow the link back to the incorrect page, it still exists for those two albums. Oh, by the way, are you an administrator? 
[[User:Bioarchie1234|Bioarchie1234]] 13:01, 17 April 2006 (PDT)
::Haha, no, I'm not an administrator. To see the administrators look at the [http://www.lyriki.com/index.php?title=Special:Listusers User List Page]. I have no idea when one of them will get to deleting those [http://www.lyriki.com/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=Template:Deletion pages] - it's long over due :(. If you see any other pages that need fixed, please contact either me or one of the other active members (such as [http://www.lyriki.com/index.php?title=User:MindlessXD MindlessXD]) and we'll get on it :) --[[User:268229|268229]] 00:03, 18 April 2006 (PDT)

[Removed comment about the commercial wiki.]
Also as a side note, lyriki was founded long, long before this other one, which was only formed around April 6th, 2006.  It had a bot scrape lyrics from sites (which most likely means lots of errors.)

::::I don't know about any other Lyrics Wiki (Lyriki was the first one I found), so I can't really answer that. There's a small, but dedicated team here, we try to keep it to a high quality of standard so there's going to be hell of a lot of edits ;) Hope you stick around and help out with the lyrics for your favorite artists and/or songs. --[[User:268229|268229]] 02:19, 18 April 2006 (PDT)
:::::Yep, I'm sticking!Thanks for your help and happy editing. [[User:Bioarchie1234|Bioarchie1234]] 23:22, 18 April 2006 (PDT)


== Promotion == 
Just wanting to know if you're interested --[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 14:42, 27 April 2006 (PDT)
:Not sure, what would I have to do as a promoted user? --[[User:268229|268229]] 19:44, 28 April 2006 (PDT)
::Mostly, you'd have access to the luverly delete function that we currently don't use often enough :).  As well as being an iconic member of Lyriki and all the pride and um special stuff that comes with it or something :P  (Ok, ok, basically you get to delete stuff :P) --[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 20:11, 28 April 2006 (PDT)
:::Delete stuff? Sounds good, I accept your offer. :) --[[User:268229|268229]] 21:03, 28 April 2006 (PDT)

== Agnostic Front Content ==
yes, the [[Agnostic Front]] page was empty, I just added the categorization as a placeholder sort of ;)  Will be working on that discography in the coming days I guess.  I see you started the Discography with full-song list.  Do you mind if I use 
the 'recommended' page format (with bio, albums, members, then links)? --[[User:Ahoier|ahoier]] 19:05, 21 May 2006 (PDT)
:No problem, do what you like as long as the song links get added ;) --[[User:268229|268229]] 22:06, 22 May 2006 (PDT)
:Alright, fixed it up ;)  Along with some other pages with your notes ;) --[[User:Ahoier|ahoier]] 04:47, 23 May 2006 (PDT)</text>

She's scared that I will take her away from there
Dreams and her country left with no one there
Mezmerize the simple minded
Propaganda leaves us blinded

I'd like to suggest a change from the naming convention of &quot;Artist - Title&quot; to just plain &quot;Title&quot;

Here are the reasons why:
* Songs are often recorded by various artists over the years. So doing Artist - Title can be misleading
* If the page was just the name of the Song then it should be easier to find using the Search function especially if the first item on this list is true

--

The reason it's artist - title is specifically because of the reason you mention, with just title we'd end up with conflicts ;)

As well, just searching for the artist, or the song, does return a list of pages with that word in it.   Try it :)

-[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 12:28, 25 December 2005 (PST)

Yeah, we talked about the possibility of doing that, but decide that we'd run into too many conflicts.  One of the major ones is that there are frequently multiple songs with the same name that are completely unrelated.  one quick example: Both Disturbed and Prodigy have songs named &quot;Breathe&quot;, and they're completely different songs.

Another problem is that even when a song is re-recorded by a new artist, sometimes the lyrics are changed slighly.  An example of this can be seen in the cover of Metro (oringally by Berlin) that System of a Down did;  the lyrics of the two are slightly different.

In the case of covers, it's probably best to just have a note on the page for whoever did the cover noting who did the original, with a link back to the original.  

-[[User:Evelyn|Evelyn]] 12:26, 25 December 2005 (PST)

:I suggest we move to KiwiLyrics's old naming scheme.  KiwiLyrics is dead, so I'm sure they won't mind.  They used the format &quot;Artist/Album&quot; and put all the lyrics from the CD on one page.  However, if lyrics from different songs must be on separate pages, the format could be &quot;Artist/Album/Title&quot;.  This was a very effective method. -[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 15:36, 27 December 2005 (PST)

I'm not sure how that's much different then what we do have already.  It seems that just uses a / instead of -.  Is there any reason in particular that that's better?  

-[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 16:03, 27 December 2005 (PST)

:It is better if a user can type &lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;http://lyriki.com/Metallica/Master_of_Puppets&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt; and get all the lyrics for that album.  As of right now, it seems that that style of URLs is disabled.  I don't know much about running a wiki, so I don't know how to turn it on, but if enabled, this style works very well.  --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 16:08, 27 December 2005 (PST)
:Another advantage is that when &quot; - &quot; is a wiki title, it's link becomes &quot;_-_&quot; which is much more difficult to type than a slash. --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 16:47, 27 December 2005 (PST)

:: the type of url you're describing has to be configured in conjunction with the apache2 server (if this wiki is running on apache2) details can be found [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eliminating_index.php_from_the_url short urls] [[User:Bailey|Bailey]] 17:27, 27 December 2005 (PST)

::: I'll have Evelyn look into this :)  That does make a bit more sense, and it seems like that'd make one of my secondary goals more easily done. (Integrating third party tools with the wiki.)  Thanks for the suggestion. -[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 22:02, 27 December 2005 (PST)

:::: Replying to myself, but, something important.  I -think- I've reached a semi-compromise on organization, and on making the URLs slightly easier, and will allow easier random browsing overall of the wiki.  I think I actually had the idea when Lyriki was first formed, but, then shit happened and we had a long time of absence and I'd forgotten (mainly cause we weren't very organized) what direction I was wanting to head.  Anyways, I digress.   Basically there's the category functionality.  Mindless has done very well setting up most of that, the biggest plus to that functionality is that certain 'index' pages update automagically when you tag the pages properly. Also, to get rid of the _-_ problem, I believe if you look at the [[Audioslave:Out_of_Exile (2005)]] page, that's an idea I had way back when as that entry is one of Lyriki's first.  That rids the _-_ thing, and makes contextual sense with how categories on wiki's work.  Please let me know what you guys think on this. --[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 20:34, 28 December 2005 (PST)

One more edit on the above subject :).   Bailey's link provides some inventive ways of using mod_rewrite, which we may look into.  However, for the time being, the search bar on the left is immensely helpful for getting somewhere fast, as well as the artist table of contents on the main page.  However, the decision to add year to avoid conflicts between albums and song names, does put a bit of a hamper on the usefulness of http://lyriki.com/Metallica/Master_Of_Puppets example as most people probably don't know the release dates of the albums, however, if the mod_rewrite stuff works, it'd be just as simple to do http://lyriki.com/Metallica and then click the appropriate album. --[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 11:56, 30 December 2005 (PST)

:[[Default:One Thing Remains (2005)|Here]] is an example that is somewhat like what KiwiLyrics had.  It eliminates song pages by puting all the songs on an album on the album page.  I'm guessing we probably won't go with this, but I wanted to show what it would look like.  --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 10:36, 31 December 2005 (PST)

::Unless there's an overwhelming demand to move to that style, I rather like having the song pages seperate myself.  To be absolutely clear, Lyriki is a service, and as such will do it's best to make itself the most useful to the people who want to use, IE: It's not entirely about what I want :P.  --[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 13:50, 31 December 2005 (PST)

:::I agree, but it seems we don't have many people around that want to give opinions. :( --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 14:08, 31 December 2005 (PST)

::::I think that'll change, Lyriki's gotten a second wind, it was a bit neglected when both Evelyn and I had other responsibilities, not much was getting added and there was little incentive to take part.  I've restarted advertising lyriki wherever I can, and have been devoting much more time to it, as well you've done a profound amount of work on the site.  It'll grow and become more and more useful.  Hopefully all the places I've been linking it from will cause it to raise in google's search ranks and more people will find Lyriki.  I've also made sure to rate it in Stumbleupon so that random people will stumble upon the site. So, I think opinions will start coming in eventually. :) --[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 16:38, 31 December 2005 (PST)

I'd like to make a suggestion for this type of discussion and others in general.  It looks like over the past few months, some key layout and formatting decisions have been made.  But, when I browse around, reading entries like this, I have a hard time knowing what's been decided and what hasn't.  I'd like to suggest maybe, at the top of one of these types of debate-entries, Nanenj or Mindless encapsulates the final decision, then leave the debate as reference, so it doesn't reappear every ten weeks.  Otherwise, newbies like me can't tell what's still up for debate, what's been settled, and what we are supposed to be doing.  Does that make sense?

:The final decisions should be reflected on the help pages.  Which decisions are ambiguous? --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 15:54, 20 February 2006 (PST)

::Well, they probably are.  I think the confusion comes from, I don't know when the actual help was written versus the discussion.  So I can't tell whether the discussion is over and the help has been updated, or if the discussion is about the existing help page, and people are looking to change it.  Does that make sense?  Even just a final statement saying something like, &quot;Since we seem to have reached a conclusion that it should be XYZ,  I went and added that to the help page.&quot;  That would indicate that the discussion is over, and sort of link the two pages together better.  Maybe. --[[User:Risser|risser]] 06:23, 21 February 2006 (PST)

== Signing Pages ==

Should users really sign artist pages, as the [[Help:Adding New Artists]] page implies?  This seems very un-wiki-esque, if that makes any sense. --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 18:55, 27 December 2005 (PST)

--

In a way it does, but, at the same time.  The reason for signing, is mainly habit.  It's especially useful on 'talk' pages, and it's decently useful any time there's multiple edits, just to keep track of who is writing what.   I also like that people are credited for their effort in initially adding something.  

It's also a 'recommendation' ;)  Which means do it if you like, don't if you don't.  I personally like that ;)

-[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 22:00, 27 December 2005 (PST)
:If lyriki is to grow, I think we will eventually have to prohibit people from signing their contributions, as does Wikipedia. Mainly because the names/IPs appear in the history and once you have 10 contributions (corrections) on one page, that't 10 signatures, which is just annoying. But hey, I just got here :-D--[[User:Orgullomoore|Orgullomoore]] 02:36, 28 December 2005 (PST)

::Meh... I had forgotten to sign my question. :P  I completely agree with signing talk pages, though. --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 15:11, 28 December 2005 (PST)

::: It's very useful on the talk pages, me thinks ;).  On the actual pages though, it's more of a sign if you're the one making the initial contribution.  If you're simply editing a small bit, or what not, signing might not be recommended.  I think on the Komm Susser Todd page I did sign something I added, but, it'd of been more appropriate for the 'talk' page on that particular song. :P  Still learning a bit :) --[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 15:25, 28 December 2005 (PST)}
::::On the talk pages we will of course have to sign...I neglected to specify that I was talking strictly about the pages in the main namespace (0)--[[User:Orgullomoore|Orgullomoore]] 01:14, 29 December 2005 (PST)

:::::I wonder how far we'll go with this indenting thing... Ahem ;).  Yar, as for normal pages, the idea from my point of view was just to sign the initial contribution, specifically on single album and lyric pages, the discography pages might have complete sections from people.  More like, if you're adding something completely new, it's at your discretion to put a signature at the end.  If you're just making a small change, correcting a typo, misheard word, etc, don't bother. --[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 01:17, 29 December 2005 (PST)

:*'''no signatures'''- thats my vote on the matter. signatures imply ownership. as in &quot;this is my opinion or view&quot; which is why we sign on talk pages. Signing articles can come up as meaning that this is an article that was created by a single person, which in the end, it isn't. [[User:Bailey|Bailey]] 12:16, 30 December 2005 (PST)

:: Perhaps you're right.  I do wish there was a way to -easily- tell initial contribution however.  I suppose the detailed history provides a way.  Most seem not to like the idea of signing contributions, so feel free to remove the existing signatures (as well as edit anything that leans towards the contrary. --[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 15:40, 30 December 2005 (PST)

== Instrument Songs ==

If a song is completely instrumental, should it have a page?  Or should the title on the album page be left linkless? --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 16:08, 29 December 2005 (PST)

:: This is one of those that took Evelyn and I awhile to even get an initial direction on, for the sake of completeness, we decided that it should have it's own page, just because their may be additional info related to that specific song.  Whilst the goal of lyriki is of course lyrics, we also aim to be as complete as possible in the information we host.  If you've nothing else to add to an instrumental track, just make the page with a note saying such.  Later, someone might drop in with who composed the tune, etc, etc, various trivial tidbits relevant to that specific track.  --[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 11:21, 30 December 2005 (PST)

== Page Deletion Requests ==

Where do I make requests for page deletion? --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 17:59, 29 December 2005 (PST)

:I went ahead and made [[:Category:Lyriki:Deletion]] for deletion requests. --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 09:30, 30 December 2005 (PST)

== Folklore songs ==

How do you handle songs where the songwriter is unknown?&lt;br&gt;
For instance I would like to add a few spanish songs that were sung sometimes by the Mexican singer/actor [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Infante Pedro Infante] and the same song by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Negrete Jorge Negrete].
They are sung the same way with minor speed differences.&lt;br&gt;Other songs are written and composed by a few songwriters and musicians i.e Raúl Lavista and Ernesto Cortázar and sung by Pedro Infante or other singers. How are those entered?&lt;br&gt;
I would like to add those songs, and attribute them to their correspondent artist(s) but don't want to create a chaos in the lyriki database ;-)&lt;br&gt;
Somehow I would also like to add &quot;Mexican Songs&quot; as a genre or something like that, if it's possible&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Some songs also appear on different albums:
 One live example already in the database:
 the album [[Thrice:If We Could Only See Us Now (2005)|If We Could Only See Us Now]] contains the song [[Thrice:The Artist In The Ambulance|Thrice:The Artist In The Ambulance (Live at the Apple Store)]] but the song only lists
 Album: [[Thrice:The Artist in the Ambulance (2003)|The Artist in the Ambulance]]
How is this handled?  -- Robi 23:15, 18 January 2006 (CST)

:In the case of the Thrice song, take a look at how [[Thrice:Cold Cash and Colder Hearts]] is done.  You can link to more than one artist album from a single page.  As for how to handle songs where the songwriter is unknown, I think there are a few possibilities.  You could do a separate entry for the song under each artist, perhaps with a note saying it was also performed by the other artists (which is actually what I would do with [[Thrice:Eleanor Rigby]], since it's actually a cover of a Beatles song), or you could do Unknown:Song Title, and then list the artists that you know have performed it.  --[[User:Evelyn|Evelyn]] 22:00, 18 January 2006 (PST)

::I think Evelyn's answered the question about songs being on multiple albums. If there's slight variations, note the variation on the songs page.  The Mexican song question, I'm not so sure I understand the question.  Typically I rely on creating links as if I could buy a CD.  If I went to a shop and could by a CD labled as 'Pedro Infante' I would list all the songs under that, due the album-based organization we have.  I would perhaps make notes if I had the information that it was written by someone else.  You present good questions that we should be able to find an answer for if we aim to be a quality database of lyrics on the net.  I guess my answer is the songs so far are only listed by the performing artist.  Even if there are multiple performances, which I believe is what Evelyn was getting at when she mentioned Eleanor Rigby since it's a cover of a Beatles song.  Both the Beatles and Thrice have performed the song.  If it's a song that can't be placed as such, as I'm sure there probably is, we need to come up with a way to uniquely title these songs to avoid confusing collisions.  Let me know what you think. --[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 23:13, 18 January 2006 (PST)

::Also, I missed where you mentioned Mexican Songs as a genre, is there something categorically different that they need an entirely different classification?  Or would it be eneough if we made a Genre category?  The only reason I've not even mentioned this before now is there can be alot of infighting in determining the genre of some domestic bands, where people get hung up on -what- type of rock something is.  Or what exactly the definition of nu-metal is, or some such silly things.  I'm not opposed to getting a Genre categorization and using that for indexing just like we do the artist and album alphabetic indexes via categories.  I just don't want to update it myself.  I could perhaps babble on a bit more, but, I think it'd be best to let others get a word in ;) --[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 23:22, 18 January 2006 (PST)

:::&lt;confused&gt; Perhaps redirect pages could be of use here, but I'm not really sure I understand what the problem is... &lt;/confused&gt; --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 17:18, 19 January 2006 (PST)

== adding lyricist(s) ==

I thought I should mention that there really should be a field to identify the author of the lyrics not just the person or group that performs the song. Quite a few songs have their lyrics written by a completely different person [[User:Bailey|Bailey]] 09:11, 23 January 2006 (PST)

:An interesting point, but, I'm not sure how many times I've had to look a song up by who wrote it?   But, there's no reason that can't be extra information attached to the individual song pages. --[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 09:47, 23 January 2006 (PST)

::I'm interested in understanding how this might work. It would be OK for me to do this to a couple of the songs that I've inputed, right? --[[User:Eric Jack Nash|Nash]] 09:49, 23 January 2006 (PST)

:::Most definately.  Feel free to experiment.  That's one of the better things.  The worst that'll happen is it'll look like ass and we'll try and decide another way of putting that information ;) --[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 09:56, 23 January 2006 (PST)

::::If nothing else, we could use the infobox style that Wikipedia uses so that all the information would be floated on the right. --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 15:29, 23 January 2006 (PST)

:::::OK, tried it, but I don't know how to get the infobox on the right, which is the whole point of doing it.  Please go to [[The Beatles:Come Together|Come Together]] and see if you can look at the code and help.  Thanks. --[[User:Eric Jack Nash|Nash]] 16:24, 23 January 2006 (PST)

::::::I like that alot. Looks really prettyful. --[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 17:09, 23 January 2006 (PST)

::::::::Thanks Bailey.  I'd like to see it and be able to easily find it.  Where is the template?  Could we get a link to it on this non-talk page that we are kind of in now, the &quot;Help:Adding New Songs&quot; page?  There's the one section called &quot;Recommended Page Format&quot; - Could we add one called &quot;Alternate Page Format&quot;?  Again, thanks. --[[User:Eric Jack Nash|Nash]] 06:19, 24 January 2006 (PST)

:::::::::Nevermind Bailey.  After typing the above, I found it, your template.  So, I've added the &quot;Alternate&quot; section.  Anyone, change, edit, if you like. --[[User:Eric Jack Nash|Nash]] 06:25, 24 January 2006 (PST)

I edited the template to the more common usage of the hiddenStructure element. HOWEVER, I'm not certain it works because i can't view the Monobook.css file to verify if there is even a hiddenStructure element in the file. I took out the lyricist in the Beatles song to experiment and the label didn't disappear, so i don't believe the hiddenStructure element is in the css file. We need an administrator to add this for the template to work.
Also in the template, what do you mean by &quot;Credited to&quot;? Is that the composer?  [[User:Troy34|Troy34]] 07:42, 4 March 2006 (PST)

== adding categories for songs ==

Is there a reason why there don't seem to be categories for songs?  I'm not saying that I/we have to have them, but it just seems odd that we have categories for artists and albums but not songs.  Any thoughts? --[[User:Eric Jack Nash|Nash]] 09:01, 24 January 2006 (PST)

:I've honestly thought a bit about it, just think it would get crowded awfully fast, but, at the same time.  It would really help if every article belonged to a category. --[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 09:45, 24 January 2006 (PST)

== &quot;The&quot; ==

I noticed that there are a ton of songs starting with &quot;The&quot; on the 'T' page.  According to the help, aren't these supposed to go with the letter of the word following &quot;The&quot;?  I did this for a couple of songs I entered, but I found that then the songs titles aren't sorted with the non-The titles.  That is, unlike the artist page, which ignores &quot;the&quot; when sorting, it displays songs with &quot;The&quot; at the end, under &quot;T:&quot;.  Can this be changed?  (This is true with Album names as well.)  --[[User:Risser|Risser]] 11:35, 16 February 2006 (EST)

: OKay, I figured it out.  In the category section at the bottom, the bit after the bar is how it's sorted.  I would say, it'd be nice to see the albums and songs showing as &lt;Title&gt; : &lt;Artist&gt; instead of Artist:Title.  It makes it difficult to follow the sorting and find what you need. --[[User:Risser|Risser]] 11:51, 16 February 2006 (EST)

== Clean vs. Dirty ==

I added lyrics for an [[Eminem:Shake_That|Eminem tune]] that I have in 2 different versions, &quot;clean&quot; and &quot;dirty&quot; (though I prefer &quot;album&quot; and &quot;radio&quot;).  I created a split-screen format that shows the lyrics side-by-side, which looks neat-o, but which may not be the best way.  Would it be better to have 2 separate pages?  Looking for feedback --[[User:Risser|risser]] 06:53, 21 February 2006 (PST)

::Looking at Eminem's discography, he only has one &quot;Shake That&quot;, I say keep it as close to the original as possible.

:::I would say both are fine, but, not neccessarily needing a fancy view or multiple pages, just put one version first, and the other version below it.  Generally, I would consider the album version authorative and should be the first listed. --[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 15:55, 12 March 2006 (PST)

:::: Yeah, you're probably right.  Although, in some cases ([[50 Cent]]'s [[50 Cent:In Da Club|In Da Club]], the lyrics are actually different.  Maybe just put them right in there with a note.  Whatever. --[[User:Risser|risser]] 19:06, 12 March 2006 (PST)

== Lyricist = Composer? ==

How often are the composer and lyricist of a song different?  Is it often enough to warrent having both fields in the templates?  Or could they be merged into one item? --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 15:09, 12 March 2006 (PST)

: I think they are different in many popular writing duos.  Like, [[Elton John]] &amp; Bernie Taupin, or [[Burt Bacharach]] and Hal David.  But I don't really see the benefit for differentiation on the line.  Just put Composer/Lyricist, or Author or whatnot.  Because when I see Holland/Dozier/Holland, or McCartney/Lennon or Nesmith/Jones/Tork/Dolenz or Jagger/Richards or Goffen/King or Gershwin/Gershwin, which is which?  I have no idea. --[[User:Risser|risser]] 19:09, 12 March 2006 (PST)

:: I think they could both be placed under either '''Composer''' or simply '''Credits'''. --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 04:32, 13 March 2006 (PST)

::: '''Credits''' works, though it might also be assumed to be Producer or Mike Nesmith, Guitar or something like that.  '''Composer''' is also pretty standard.  I guess, if people know, they can include the lyricist, and if not, they don't. --[[User:Risser|risser]] 06:56, 13 March 2006 (PST)

== shortening lyrics (chorus/verse notation)? ==

I've seen some lyrics on the site, that use [Chorus] or [Verse], or (#x); to indicate a phrase/line repetition, similar to that which the artists themselves use in their album booklets and such.  I personally find these annoying and confusing (especially where the artist doesn't stick to the Chorus the second or third time it's referenced).  So, I guess I was just wondering if there's any standard for this.  I personally like the linear approach of things.  If the phrase &quot;raise hell&quot; is repeated 4 times, then use
&lt;lyrics&gt;raise hell
raise hell
raise hell
raise hell&lt;/lyrics&gt;
or if the chorus/verse is repeated, just copy/paste it where it should be and modify it if the artist changed any words around. --[[User:Ahoier|ahoier]] 08:12, 27 May 2006 (PDT)
:The accuracy of lyrics is a key factor at Lyriki, so if a song does indeed have a slightly different chorus each time its used, feel free to edit it so it is right. Expanding the lyrics to the linear approach is a good idea, especially since some songs have two or more chorus' and it can get confusing ;) --[[User:268229|268229]] 16:47, 27 May 2006 (PDT)

::The &quot;linear&quot; approach was the standard at KiwiLyrics, and I think it should also be the standard here since it is much less confusing... We are working with a server where space is expendable, the artists are working with a booklet where it is not. --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 20:33, 27 May 2006 (PDT)

:Sounds good to me.  I'll keep what I'm doing then :)  and yea, that's what came to mind too :P  Looking through this [[No Doubt]] booklet for Tragic Kingdom, a lot of their lyrics seem to be cut short...unless they just think people won't care for the other stuff (usually the end). --[[User:Ahoier|ahoier]] 03:59, 28 May 2006 (PDT)

==different versions of songs?==
What's the policy on different versions of songs by the same artist? Many artists have a differently recorded version of a song on a different album, and the lyrics are a little different.

Also, some pairs of songs may not have the '''exact''' same title, using [[Smash Mouth:Come On, Come On|Come On, Come On]] and [[Smash Mouth:Come On Come On|Come On Come On]] by Smash Mouth from two different albums as examples (one song has a comma in the title; I've checked three music sites and they all say that one has the comma and one doesn't), which are also different recordings. Should there be one page for both, or one for each? We could even have one page for each and make a template for a small box at the top that would say something like &quot;This song is an alternate recording of _______ from the album _______. Did you mean to find that version?&quot; or something similar to that. Any ideas or suggestions? --[[User:Qhiiyr|Qhiiyr]] 21:40, 12 June 2006 (PDT)

:: Me and [[User:Ahoier|Ahoier]] have had similar issues with some of the Sum41 songs with [[Sum 41:Go Chuck Yourself (2006)|Go Chuck Yourself]] and [[Sum 41:Chuck (2004)|Chuck]] albums. We used the {{Song template (opposed to {{SSong ) to include both the albums and we decided to put the original studio album lyrics listed first.
::hope this helps. - --[[User:Sidewinded|Sidewinded]] 21:49, 12 June 2006 (PDT)

::I'd recommend using a template like your example.  If two songs have the same title but different lyrics, I propose appending &quot; ('''SONG'S_ALBUM''')&quot; to the page title, if that makes sense. --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 17:53, 13 June 2006 (PDT)

::[[User:Attendant]] brought something interesting to my attention.  Over at [[Evergreen Terrace:(Untitled Track)]] I was using 2 lyric tags, and titling each section to display the different lyrics (since that track appears on multiple albums).  But yea, apparantly the lyrics plugin for Kamarok (I know I'm spelling that wrong..) can't cope with multiple lyrics tags on a single page.  So, only 1 lyric tag can be on each page, and HTML bold and italic tags should be used within those lyric tags to seperate/label the lyrics.  To see the complete conversation, check out my talk page.  Perhaps we need to create another standard and/or template to deal with tracks that appear on multiple albums? --[[User:Ahoier|ahoier]] 07:34, 25 June 2006 (PDT)

:::I actually thought I'd addressed this in the decisions for our naming scheme once upon a time.  Multiple versions of the same song by the same artist are the only times this becomes an issue, and in that case, you can simply list lyrics for the first version, then lyrics for the second version, and so on.  So, from what I understand of the above, is that Ahoier and Sidewinded have the right idea :). --[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 13:58, 30 September 2006 (PDT)

== Plural in SSong template ==

When using the SSong template, it always says &quot;album'''s'''&quot; and &quot;composer'''s'''&quot; in the little info box, even if there is only one album this track appears on/ one composer to the song. On the other hand, the lyricist always stays singular, even if there several people responsible. I'm not really understanding how templates work, though, so I don't know how (if?) this could be fixed. Anyone? --[[User:Notimeless|Notimeless]] 04:20, 3 December 2006 (UTC+1)

:Hrm... I guess it was assumed that there would only be one lyricist.  --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 17:41, 4 December 2006 (PST)
::I think the main concern, is the plural of &quot;album&quot; and &quot;composer&quot; even when only 1 album is listed.  But yea, I've no idea about template coding and whether or not it's possible to change it so that if there's only 1 album, then make it &quot;Album&quot;, else, &quot;Album&lt;b&gt;s&lt;/b&gt;&quot;. --ahoier 10:38, 8 December 2006 (PST)

:::Not without a lot of annoyances for users. --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 15:06, 8 December 2006 (PST)
::::Well, we could always go for the catch-all solution of putting &quot;Album(s)&quot;/&quot;Composer(s)&quot; every time... --[[User:Notimeless|Notimeless]] 02:45, 9 December 2006 (PST)

== Cover versions ==

Thought it'd be nice to be able to show when lyrics where covered by another artist. Created a new template called cover and set up an example on [[Nine_Inch_Nails:Hurt]] It doesn't look the best but it does get the point across and I personally find it fascinating to see all the artists who cover a particular song [[User:Bailey|Bailey]] 16:35, 26 February 2007 (PST)

:Hey, glad to know you're still alive. ;)  We've got a [[Template:cover of|template for cover songs]] and now we've got one for covered songs -- if you don't mind, I'd like to rename it to match the template we have (ie. [[Template:Covered by]]). --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 19:18, 26 February 2007 (PST)
::Hey Man :) Its the whole life,new job,engagement thing has been keeping me busy. Well darn I missed that or I would have done something different. Still don't feel that we've nailed handling covers correctly yet so I'm going to play around for a couple of days with different ideas, feel free to rename that template. Oh and I downloaded the WMP api kit to see about creating a plugin, if you guys are still looking, I should probably tell you this weekend if I'm going to have time to whip something together. --[[User:Bailey|Bailey]] 15:38, 27 February 2007 (PST)
:::We're definately still looking, and even more so now.  I've even considered offering up bounties on certain features that we could really use.  But, considering those would be coming out of pocket, I just haven't been able to yet. --[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 17:04, 27 February 2007 (PST)

== Near-identical songs ==

I was recently working on the page for [[Alan_Parsons:On_Air_(1996)|On Air]] by [[Alan_Parsons|Alan Parsons]], and it includes two songs that have the same title, artist, album, and year (namely, &quot;Blue Blue Sky&quot; as tracks 1 and 11). Despite the similarities, they're different songs - one is almost three minutes longer than the other. Is there a standard way to differentiate between these two? [[User:Lithium3141|Lithium3141]] 05:20, 16 October 2009 (UTC)

:I don't think we have a policy for dealing with that situation.  I'm thinking the best solution would be to put both the songs on the page and have give the two tracks under separate headings within that page.  That way lyrics plugins for audio players can grab both tracks' lyrics for each track (instead of grabbing one of the track's lyrics for both tracks, which is what would probably happen if they were on different pages.)  However, if you think another way would work best, go for it. --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 20:46, 16 October 2009 (UTC)

== Parallel singing and markup ==

There are some songs where two different lyrics get sung in parallel. To give you an example:&lt;br&gt;
 http://www.lyriki.com/Disturbed:Asylum
 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1K9jBL2syJ8 (starting at 2:30, until 2:40)

 Terror is coursing in me
 (Death inside of me, keeps a diligent watch on everything)
 Dreading the final moment when I have to dream
 (Keeps a terrible hold on my belief. Just waiting for the moment  when I)
 And feel you die

The problem is that this kind of markup is already used for &quot;answers&quot; usually from an other singer. At least I found it on many lyrics. Maybe some kind of markup guidelines for lyrics would be great. This would also avoid the problem that some lyrics end up with lots of punctuations (a dot or comma at the end of a line isn't a good idea IMO, because you don't need them and in many cases they destroy intentional ambiguities in lyrics. I am sure there are more people who have problems choosing the right style writing lyrics. An uniform style would also make stuff easier to read for humans and maybe computers, if you try to parse lyrics for whatever reason. --[[User:Athaba|Athaba]] 08:23, 17 November 2010 (PST)</text>

Long ago
Just like the hearse you die to get in again
We are so far from you

Burning on just like a match you strike to incinerate
The lives of everyone you know
And what's the worst you take
from every heart you break
And like the blade you stain
Well I've been holding on tonight

What's the worst that I can say?
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight

Came a time
When every star fall brought you to tears again
We are the very hurt you sold
And what's the worst you take
from every heart you break
And like the blade you stain
Well I've been holding on tonight

What's the worst that I can say?
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight
And if you carry on this way
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight

Can you hear me?
Are you near me?
Can we pretend to leave and then
We'll meet again
When both our cars collide?

What's the worst that I can say?
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight
And if you carry on this way
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight
&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;
I never said I'd lie and wait forever
If I died we'd be together
I can't always just forget her
But she could try

At the end of the world
Or the last thing I see
You are
Never coming home
Never coming home
Could I?
Should I?
And all the things that you never ever told me
And all the smiles that are ever ever...

Ever...
Get the feeling that you're never
All alone and I remember now
At the top of my lungs in my arms she dies
She dies

At the end of the world
Or the last thing I see
You are
Never coming home
Never coming home
Could I?
Should I?
And all the things that you never ever told me
And all the smiles that are ever gonna haunt me
Never coming home
Never coming home
Could I?
Should I?
And all the wounds that are ever gonna scar me
For all the ghosts that are never gonna catch me

If I fall
If I fall
(Down)

At the end of the world
Or the last thing I see
You are
Never coming home
Never coming home
Never coming home
Never coming home
And all the things that you never ever told me
And all the smiles that are ever gonna haunt me
Never coming home
Never coming home
Could I?
Should I?
And all the wounds that are ever gonna scar me
For all the ghosts that are never gonna...

&lt;b&gt;Lyrics to song&lt;/b&gt;
Well if you wanted honesty, that's all you had to say.
I never want to let you down or have you go, it's better off this way.
For all the dirty looks, the photographs your boyfriend took
Remember when you broke your foot from jumping out the second floor

I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out

What will it take to show you that it's not the life it seems
(I'm not okay)
I told you time and time again you sing the words but don't know what it means
(I'm not okay)
To be a joke and look, another line without a hook
I held you close as we both shook for the last time take a good hard look

I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out

Forget about the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
You said you read me like a book, but the pages are all torn and frayed

I'm okay
I'm okay!
I'm okay, now
(I'm okay, now)

But you really need to listen to me
Because I'm telling you the truth
I mean this, I'm okay
Trust Me

I'm not okay
I'm not okay
Well, I'm not okay
I'm not o-fucking-kay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
(Okay)
&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;
He calls the mansion not a house, but a tomb
He's always choking from the stench and the fume
The wedding party all collapsed in the room
So send my resignation to the bride and the groom

Let's go down
This elevator only goes up to ten
He's not around; he's always looking at men
Down by the pool
He doesn't seem to have many friends as they are
Face down and bloated snap shot with the lens

If you marry me
would you bury me
Would you carry me to the end

So say goodbye to the vows you take
And say goodbye to the life you make
And say goodbye to the heart you break
And all the cyanide you drank

She keeps a picture of the body she lends
Got nasty blisters from the money she spends
She's got a life of her own
And it shows by the Benz
she drives at 90 by the Barbies and Kens

If you ever say never too late
I'll forget all the diamonds you ate
Lost in coma and covered in cake
Increase the medication
Share the vows at the wake
Kiss the bride

If you marry me
would you bury me
Would you carry me to the end

So say goodbye to the vows you take
And say goodbye to the life you make
And say goodbye to the heart you break
And all the cyanide you drank

So say goodbye to the last parade
And walk away from the choice you made
And say goodnight to the heart you break
And all the cyanide you drank

So say goodbye to the vows you take
And say goodbye to the life you make
And say goodbye to the heart you break
And all the cyanide you drank

So say goodbye to the last parade
And walk away from the choice you made
And say goodnight to the heart you break
And all the cyanide you drank

So say goodbye to the last parade
And walk away as the parties fade
And say goodnight to the heart you break
And all the cyanide you drank
To the end
&lt;/lyrics&gt;

In the middle of a gun fight
In the center of a restaurant
They say come with your arms raised high
Well, they're never gonna get me
Im like a bullet through a flock of doves
To rage this war against your faith in me
Your life...will never be the same
On your mother's eyes, say a prayer, say a prayer

[Chorus]
Now, but who cares
And I don't know
How we're just human as God had made us
Well, I can't, well I can
Too much, too late, or just not enough of this
pain in my heart for your dying wish,
I kiss your lips again.

WeThey all cheat at cards and the checkers are lost,
My cellmate's a killer, they make me do push-ups (in drag)
But nobody cares if you're losing yourself, am I losing myself
Well, I miss my mom,
will they give me the chair
A lethal injection, a swing from a rope if you dare
Ah, nobody knows...all the trouble I've seen

[Chorus]

To your room
What they ask of you
Will make you want to say, so long
Well, I don't remember
Why remember... you

Do you have the keys to the hotel
Goodbye String this motherfucker on fire, fire

Life is but a dream for the dead
And well I, I won't go down on myself
But I'll go down with my friends
Now now now now...now now now...now now now
&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Get your party gown and get your pigtail down
And get your heart beating baby
Got my timing right I got my act all tight

It's gotta be tonight
My little school babe
Your momma says you don't
And your daddy says you won't
And I'm boiling up inside
Ain't no way I'm gonna lose out this time

Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Lock your daddy out of doors
I don't need him nosing around
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Give me all your love tonight

You're such a dirty louse go get outa my house
That's all I ever get from your family ties
In fact I don't think I ever heard
A single little civil word from those guys
I don't give a light
I'm gonna make out all right
I've got a sweetheart hand
To put a stop to all that
Sniping and grousing

Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Take your little brother swimming
With a brick that's all right
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Or you ain't no friend of mine

Your momma and your daddy
Gonna blame me till I die
I can't understand it
'Cause I'm a peace lovin' guy
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Get that big big big big big big
Daddy out the door
Tie your mother down yeah
Tie your mother down
Give me all your love tonight
All your love tonight&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Empacó un par de camisas, un sombrero, 
Su vocación de aventurero 
Seis consejos, siete fotos mil recuerdos. 

Empacó sus ganas de quedarse 
Su condición de transformarse 
En el hombre que soñó y no ha logrado. 

Dijo 'adiós' con una mueca disfrazada de sonrisa 
Y le suplicó a su dios crucificado en la repisa 
El resguardo de los suyos y perduró la frontera como pudo 

Si la luna suave se desliza por cualquier cornisa 
Sin permiso alguno, ¿por qué el mojado precisa 
Comprobar con visas que no es de Neptuno? 

El mojado tiene ganas de secarse 
El mojado está mojado 
Por las lágrimas que brotan la nostalgia 
El mojado, el indocumentado, carga el bulto 
Que el legal no cargaría ni obligado 


De su precio de un papel lo ha convertido 
En fugitivo y no es de aquí porque su nombre 
No aparece en los archivos ni es de allá porque se fue 

Si la luna suave se desliza por cualquier cornisa 
Sin permiso alguno, ¿por qué el mojado precisa 
Comprobar con visas que no es de Neptuno? 

Mojado, sabía a mentira tu verdad 
Sabía a tristeza la ansiedad 
De ver un freeway y soñar 
Con la vereda que conduce hasta tu casa 

Mojado, mojado de tanto llorar sabiendo que en algún lugar 
Te espera un beso haciendo pausa desde el día en que te marchaste 

Si la luna suave se desliza por cualquier cornisa 
Sin permiso alguno, ¿por qué el mojado precisa 
Comprobar con visas que no es de Neptuno? 

Si la visa universal se extiende el día en que nacemos 
Y caduca en la muerte, ¿por qué te persiguen, mojado, 
Si el cónsul de los cielos ya te dio permiso?&lt;/lyrics&gt;

----

&lt;lyrics&gt;Un minuto más y ya te irás
Corrió tan rápido la aguja en el reloj
Entre tanto adios y tanto amar
Sin darnos cuenta nuestro, tiempo se voló

Y ojalá que vuelva igual de rápido
Cuando ya te hayas ido,
Cuando ya te hayas ido
Para no sentir que muero de dolor
Cuando no estés conmigo,
Cuando no estés conmigo.

Porque no solamente tu te irás
Con tu adios
También llevas un pedazo de mi alma y de mi vida
Entre tu vida
Sin contar los sueños y las ilusiones que se anidan
En tu sonrisa
Te voy a extrañar
Mi amor, te voy a extrañar

Y ojalá que vuelva igual de rápido
Cuando ya te hayas ido,
Cuando ya te hayas ido
Para no sentir que muero de dolor
Cuando no estés conmigo,
Cuando no estés conmigo.

Porque no solamente tú te irás
Con tu adios
También llevas un pedazo de mi alma y de mi vida
Entre tu vida
Sin contar los sueños y las ilusiones que se anidan 
En tu sonrisa
Te voy a extrañar
Mi amor te voy a extrañar

Un minuto más y ya te irás
Un minuto más
Un minuto más&lt;/lyrics&gt;

== talk page spam ==

Hello, any chance of locking the [[Talk:Bad Religion:Drunk Sincerity|Bad Religion - Drunk Sincerity]] talk page?  Lots of spam being posted there lately. --ahoier 07:50, 27 November 2006 (PST)

:Unless it gets extremely bad, we'll probably just keep banning IPs. --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 15:14, 27 November 2006 (PST)
:Alright sounds good. --ahoier 17:58, 27 November 2006 (PST)
::some more here that you can ban :) [[Talk:Blackalicious:A to G]] --ahoier 07:26, 15 April 2007 (PDT)

== &quot;Die Ärzte:Ab 18&quot; ==

Why did you delete the information I wrote at the beginning of the page? Just so I know it for my later contributions.

:Sorry about that, it's back.  I commentted it out mainly because it doesn't quite make sense grammatically. --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 15:41, 16 January 2007 (PST)

::Sorry, I'm from Germany. That should explain it. ;)

== Main Page ==
Why did you reverted my changes to the main page?&lt;br/&gt;
The current layout wastes a lot of horizontal space which is what I really wanted to fix in the first place :(&lt;br/&gt;
--[[User:Attendant|Attendant]] 19:02, 18 January 2007 (PST)

:The majority of your changes were kept: basically everything except parts of the layout changes -- those were reverted because that layout was broken in Konqueror.  From the edit summary I assumed that browser compatibility was what you were trying to fix.  I agree the whitespace is a waste, but perhaps it could be filled with something instead of pushing the sidebar into the main content.  In any case, unless you're at 800x600, the current whitespace is more than bareable. --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 20:09, 18 January 2007 (PST)

::Please, take a look at [[Main Page/Sandbox]]. I've tested it in Firefox (Windows and Linux), IE (6.0 and 7.0) and Konqueror and it's looking ok. If there's anything else you want to change, go ahead and do it. The current layout looks bad and there's not reason to bear with it (unless we disagree on that). --[[User:Attendant|Attendant]] 19:38, 21 January 2007 (PST)

:::A quick poll on the IRC channel shows that the masses like your layout better, so go for it. --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 20:20, 21 January 2007 (PST)

== Search feature and encoding issues... ==
I've been playing around with the search function and I've verified that '''the search is not case sensitive''' as I used to think (if only I had realized this before...) This is a really good thing since it means we don't need to use redirects the way we are using it right now (which is also being enforced by the script). However, not everything is good. I'm pretty sure there's an encoding related problem with the server configuration. I've seen an encoding error many times when trying to check [[Special:Ipblocklist|the blocked IPs page]] (though I haven't seen that error in awhile) and I also verified now that searching for [http://www.lyriki.com/Special:Search?search=Die+%C3%84rzte&amp;fulltext=Search terms which contain non ASCII characters] yields no results (look at the page titles matches). For the time being I can search also through the page text matches but that is less reliable and just a workaround. In any case, it's lame ([http://lyricwiki.org/Special:Search?search=%E5%B7%9D%E7%94%B0%E3%81%BE%E3%81%BF&amp;fulltext=Search the LyricWiki guys can performs full Unicode searches] and we are are stuck with 7 bit ASCII!) and we should fix it ASAP. I don't have access to the server nor know what to fix or where to look (though I could try to do some research) to fix this, so if you can take a look at this, please do it. If you can't (don't have the access or whatever) and can contact any of the other administrators (they haven't appeared here in a long time...) then, please do that. --[[User:Attendant|Attendant]] 23:49, 22 January 2007 (PST)

:I actually know what the cause of this is.  I should be able to fix it, it'll just take some time and may require bringing the site down temporarily to fix it.  Basically the cause of this is the fact that when Lyriki was started, the version of MediaWiki we were using used latin1 as its character set.  In order to switch to Unicode support I'm going to have to convert the text data type on all the fields in the database, which could possibly take a while (I'm not sure).  This is actually why some of the pages gave errors: one of the updates we've made since our initial installation updated some of the page title fields, but not all of them.  I've since updated all the title fields, but the amount of data stored in them is much smaller.  I'll try to get this fixed soon. --[[User:Evelyn|Evelyn]] 14:25, 23 January 2007 (PST)
:: Not sure if this problem is ''supposed'' to be fixed now (the site has already been down for a while today) but, just in case you think so, [http://www.lyriki.com/Special:Search?search=Die+%C3%84rzte&amp;fulltext=Search it's not fixed yet]. --[[User:Attendant|Attendant]] 17:34, 23 January 2007 (PST)
::: Just tried submitting a song in simplified Chinese (since I've added support for Chinese and Indian sites to WL)... it won't work. I assume it's related to this since uploading to LyricWiki went fine. --[[User:Attendant|Attendant]] 23:02, 26 January 2007 (PST)
:Shall we drop the redirect policy? --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 17:13, 23 January 2007 (PST)

:: Yes we should, since they don't really help us in the search area and that policy doesn't improves any other aspect of the site. Redirects usefulness but is mostly limited to the cases where articles can arguably addressed by ''different'' names (cases where the search won't help much) such as [[POD]], [[P.O.D.]] or [[Payable on Death]], etc. --[[User:Attendant|Attendant]] 17:34, 23 January 2007 (PST)

== Recent Changes ==

Hey, been awhile since I was on here.

On the recent changes page, theres this new number thing in the list.


(diff) (hist) . . N Prodigy:Ruff in the Jungle Bizness‎; 14:50 . . '''(+742)''' . . Groo (Talk | contribs) (autogen. song page (WLv0.10))


Mind filling me in what it is?
--[[User:Sidewinded|Sidewinded]] 15:39, 2 April 2007 (PDT)

:That's the number of characters that were added in that revision.  The number is negative if there have been more characters removed than added. (And thus can be 0 if the same number were added as were removed.)  Mainly it's for watching for vandals who remove large amounts of text or spammers who added a lot of spam links. ;) --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 17:00, 2 April 2007 (PDT)

:: AWESOME. Thats a great idea. Kudos! --[[User:Sidewinded|Sidewinded]] 19:39, 2 April 2007 (PDT)

== Hi ==

Hi, I'm new to this Wiki and I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to write this. I have a couple of questions:

1. I've been taking a look through the bot-generated lyrics and I have a couple of questions regarding that:
a. Is there any way to make it easier to navigate? Instead of it just &quot;Next 200&quot;, &quot;Previous 200&quot; etc. can it be made to be a page dedicated to &quot;A&quot; and another to &quot;B&quot;. Yes, it's probably a little bit of wasted space (because there may not be many &quot;A&quot;) but it would make navigation '''so''' much easier.
b. When I verify the lyrics, I've removed the warning, like it said. The song is removed from the list automatically, correct?

2. The blatantly obvious duplicates of songs - can they be deleted &amp; how do you delete them? [[User:Advocatus|Advocatus]] 10:04, 16 July 2007 (PDT)

:1. a. you'd have to ask [[User:Attendant|Attendant]] about that
:1. b. yes
:2. yes, put &lt;nowiki&gt;{{deletion}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; at the top and an administrator will come along and delete it --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 21:34, 19 July 2007 (PDT)

== Anonymous Edits ==
I'd like to make the point for banning anonymous edits. As you already know, a vandal bot has been targeting the site for quite a few weeks now. Unfortunately, we're not exactly abundant on the man power needed to cope with and I definitely don't like the prospect of having to continue chasing this moron indefinitely.&lt;br/&gt;You could say I'm biased since I always thought people who care enough to contribute can also be bothered with registering to the site... nevertheless I'd rather not to piss on anybody's right to post &quot;anonymously&quot; if they feel that gives them some kind of privacy (though if their are concerned with privacy, having their IP logged and publicly displayed is as bad as it gets... but that's another issue). Regardless, the fact is that currently most of our legit contributions are from registered users, and that the vandal bot &quot;contributions&quot; outnumber by a large margin those from good willed anonymous contributors. Considering this, I think the best would be to ban anonymous contributions temporarily, until the vandal bot quits trashing the site. What do you think about it? --[[User:Attendant|Attendant]] 18:48, 29 October 2007 (PDT)
:I agree, it's becoming more than irritating. I'll poke [[User:Evelyn|Evelyn]] about it. --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 19:07, 29 October 2007 (PDT)

== new song template ==

Hey, I noticed the template change, and it messed up this page, which contains a &quot;Featured artist&quot; - [[No Doubt:Underneath It All]].  Any ideas?  Maybe the Lady Saw could just be removed, I don't know hehe.  I know MusicBrainz references the featured artist(s) within the song title.  --[[User:Ahoier|ahoier]] 07:34, 24 December 2007 (PST)

:I'm not really sure.  I don't know the significance of being a featured artist of a song.  I suppose there could be an added field for being featured on a song... depends on how important it is. --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 12:09, 24 December 2007 (PST)

:Alright, [[Beyonce:Check_on_It|example]] of how I'd suggest it should be done. --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 10:54, 25 December 2007 (PST)

: Take a look at [http://www.lyriki.com/User_talk:Attendant#ssong this], please. --[[User:Attendant|Attendant]] 13:17, 25 December 2007 (PST)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1216">Here you can request a song be added to Lyriki's database. Before you posting here, be sure to search for the song using the search box in the left. Try searching for '''Artist''':'''Song''' for best results. I you can't find it, add your request by adding the &lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''Artist''':'''Song''']] link to the list and, optionally, any other information you consider useful. If you're looking to all the lyrics in an album, ''do not request the album directly'', but list its songs instead.

&lt;lyrics&gt;Strange how my heart beats
To find myself upon your shore.
Strange how I still feel
My loss of comfort gone before.

Cool waves wash over
And drift away with dreams of youth
So time is stolen
I cannot hold you long enough.

And so this is where I should be now
Days and nights falling by
Days and nights falling by me.
I know of a dream I should be holding
Days and nights falling by
Days and nights falling by me.

Soft blue horizons
Reach far into my childhood days
As you are rising
To bring me my forgotten ways.

Strange how I falter
To find I'm standing in deep water
Strange how my heart beats
To find I'm standing on your shore.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Imaged marred by self infliction,
Private wars on my soul waged.
Heart is scarred by dual volitions,
Juxtaposed and both engaged.
Kindle flame, a test of faith,
Pray help me see it through.
I put all my trust in you.

Refine hate and love,
Fall afresh on me,
End this crisis of identity

Draw this darkness out like poison;
Stab, retrieve, again decline.
Help me draw the dagger deeper;
Trace with me explicit lines.
Take this blade, a test of faith,
And strike me deep and true.
I put all my trust in you.

Refine hate and love,
Fall afresh on me,
End this crisis of identity.

This is my voice, all shadows stayed
This is my heart upon the altar layed
Please take all else away
Hear my cry I beg, I plead, I pray.
I'll walk into the flames, 
A calculated risk to further bless your name
So strike me deep and true
And in your strength I will live and die both unto you.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

do we really want all the song titles on the artist page?  this really nullifies the usefulness of album pages. --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 18:23, 29 December 2005 (PST)

:I've had trouble thinking about that, I -do- like the entire discography on one page, but, I like the pretty arrangement including album art.  I tested album art on one of the queen pages, I don't quite like the effect adding the album art has on the entire discography thing.  It's for sure something open for discussion.  As well, having the individual album pages allows for a cleaner sorting by category.  It may be slightly (mostly) redundant, but, it also depends on what exactly your after.  The complete discography pages have little that can be added to them.  But, since it's an 'artist' titled page that lists the discography, general information about the band can be on that page.  The specific album pages, aside from tracklists, can house a multitude of other information, such as who wrote the individual songs, the band members in the band at the time of the song.  (As well, forgive me, I've been using Artist and Band interchangeably).  It's kind of segmentation that's slightly redundant, but, in my own opinion keeps some more structure.  Might not be needed, as I've been questioning that myself, but, I -like- the album pages ;P  if that makes any sense. --[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 18:47, 29 December 2005 (PST)

:One thing to add to this, is something I've realized whilst editing tons of stuff ;).  It's very easy to revert changes, move stuff around, etc.  If the general consensus is to do something different then the above, it can easily be changed.  There's only a few things I think I'm almost certain about, but, I'm sure even those I could be persuaded given the pros and cons. --[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 18:50, 29 December 2005 (PST)

:Yay, yet another consecutive comment for me ;).  Two people I've talked to about this have actually asked why we don't use both discographies x.X?  It's something I haven't even thought of... This would be a prettier way of having an artist's own discography table of contents instead of the long list of links that shows up because of the &lt;nowiki&gt;== Header ==&lt;/nowiki&gt; used in the long discography versions. I'm not too sure on this, but, figured since it's been suggested twice, it's something worth tossing out for consideration. --[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 00:24, 31 December 2005 (PST)

::I'm not sure what you mean &quot;use both discographies&quot;. --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 08:04, 31 December 2005 (PST)

:I got here because I was thinking the same thing... why list song titles on the artist page. I think it would make sense to have a list of albums on the artist page and then the lost of songs on the album page. So thats my input :)  [[User:Bailey|Bailey]] 18:21, 22 January 2006 (PST)

::Most of the artist pages I've done are using short discography.  I'm not sure why long discography has been adopted by most entries despite the debate and popular opinion that the short ones make more sense :P.  To be entirely honest, it doesn't matter much to me what way is decided on, there's a question asking this somewhere, and most that answered said short. :P  To Mindless, Both was a suggestion of having a preceding list of albums, much like the TOC provides.  It didn't make much sense to me then, and still doesn't.  But, when I get suggestions I feel they need to be stated anyways. --[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 10:30, 27 January 2006 (PST)

Well, for giggles, I updated the [[Queen]] page to include both the short and long discographies, so you can see how it looks.  I also included a couple of mini-album covers in the long section.  Let me know how you think it looks.  I'm still a fan of the short discog, but I thought it'd be handy to see how this actually looks.  Also, I sorted the albums by year, before I realized they were in alphabetical order.  However, I think year is the more standard way for albums to be listed, so... --[[User:Risser|risser]] 06:57, 20 February 2006 (PST)

:How should be handle non-album tracks?  I don't think there should be a seperate page for them, but instead they should be listed below the discography.  What does everyone else think? --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 15:58, 20 February 2006 (PST)

::I agree, non-album, remixes, B-Sides, etc. shouldn't have a seperate page (unless you're doing the short discography, then you'll be forced to do it =P). Like how ohhla do it ;)--[[User:268229|268229]] 22:43, 20 February 2006 (PST)

:::  Technically speaking, is there such a thing as a non-album track?  I mean, it must have come from SOMEWHERE, even if it's the B-Side of a single, the second track on a CD Single or 12-inch EP or a new track on a greatest hits comp.  I suppose in this day and age of digital downloads, it's possible to get a track that has '''no''' context whatsoever, but that's pretty unusual.  (Or, you may just not know where it comes from...)  We may want to expand the Discography to have different sections (similar to AllMusic): Albums, Artist Compilations, Various Artist Compilations, Singles and EPs, non-Album Tracks.  
:::  One other thing to consider might be, why keep album info at all?  If this is really about song-lyrics, then any album data could be considered superfluous, except that which is necessary to distinguish 2 versions of a song.  I mean, in the Queen example, we could simply list every Queen song in alphabetical order.  Why bother presenting a discography?
:::  Now, I like the discography, but there are already several discography sites available, including AllMusic, MusicBrainz and others, who are way far ahead of us.  So, do we really want to get into the discography business?  Or should we concentrate on songs and song lyrics?  Or, should we split the difference and include discographies, but keep them &quot;unofficial&quot; with the emphasis on song lyrics?
:::  I don't know.  Just kicking ideas around. --[[User:Risser|risser]] 06:32, 21 February 2006 (PST)
:::: Context helps people find the lyrics they want and it helps them search for related information. The nicething about the whole wioki thing is that if your entering song information , you don't have to put in the album details but if someone wants to come along behind and include it... all the more power. I also think context is great and I would like to see more. I would like to have categories on the year the song was released and even a genre category ( ie 1987 alternative bands )but thats me --[[User:Bailey|Bailey]] 11:22, 22 February 2006 (PST)

So, have we all decided that we are going to the &quot;short discography&quot; (no songs on the artist page)?  That's what it seems like.  In either case, I'd like to settle this debate once and for all.  What say we?

I personally like the short discography/artist page myself; with each individual album having it's own page, with release date(s), album art, etc. --[[User:Ahoier|ahoier]] 06:50, 27 May 2006 (PDT)

I'm a major n00b here and want to add artists. I read the tutorial, and understand the 
-format- but don't know where to put it. Please tell me where exactly I'd find that info.

: Artist pages are simply the artist name, for example [[Metallica]].  If you're wondering how to create pages, you can type the artist name into the search box and hit &quot;Go&quot; then click &quot;create this page&quot;. --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 15:30, 25 August 2006 (PDT)

== proposal for a change to artist information layout ==

After messing around with some artist pages (specifically [[Iron Maiden]]) I'd like to suggest changing

 == Artist Info ==
 Website: ['''url''' '''url''']
 
 '''place additional artist information here'''
 
 == &lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''Artist''':'''Album''' ('''Year''')|'''Album''']] ==
 # &lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''Artist''':'''Song'''|]]
 # &lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''Artist''':'''Song'''|]]
 # &lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''Artist''':'''Song'''|]]
 # &lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''Artist''':'''Song'''|]]
 
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;Category:Artists]]
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;Category:Artists:'''Letter''']]

to 

 == Artist Info ==
 Website: ['''url''' '''url''']
 
 '''place additional artist information here'''
 
 == Discography ==
 
 === &lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''Artist''':'''Album''' ('''Year''')|'''Album''']] ===
 # &lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''Artist''':'''Song'''|]]
 # &lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''Artist''':'''Song'''|]]
 # &lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''Artist''':'''Song'''|]]
 # &lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''Artist''':'''Song'''|]]
 
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;Category:Artists]]
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;Category:Artists:'''Letter''']]

I think this increases the consistency between the two type of artist pages as well as looking better with a large number of albums. Also I added a template to create a floating TOC, an artist page wityh a lot of albums loses information if the TOC isn't floating. Once again [[Iron Maiden]] being the example [[User:Bailey|Bailey]] 10:43, 27 January 2006 (PST)

:I see no reason for anyone to disagree with that change.  --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 15:01, 27 January 2006 (PST)--

I think I just realized where the idea of putting the list of songs came from, and I'm betting it's cause the guides still have both format's listed with that one first.  The format I favor is actually...

 == Artist Info ==
 Website: ['''url''' '''url''']
 
 '''place additional artist information here'''
 
 == Discography ==
 * '''Year''' &lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''Artist''':'''Album''' ('''Year''')|'''Album''']]
 * '''Year''' &lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''Artist''':'''Album''' ('''Year''')|'''Album''']]
 * '''Year''' &lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''Artist''':'''Album''' ('''Year''')|'''Album''']]

===Another Proposal===
...for a more Wikipedia-like page style for new artist pages. See [[Anberlin]].  Objections? --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 20:45, 5 February 2006 (PST)

== An Update ==

Okay, I updated the help page for artists a bit.  Primarily, I added sections for Members/Member Of and  more detailed discographies.  Also, I reconfigured the &quot;Alternate Template&quot; section as an &quot;Alternate Discography&quot; instead, which is really what it is, as the rest of the template stays the same.  I kinda updated this based on stuff I'd done and stuff I've seen others do, so if you want to change something, have at it.  Thanks! --[[User:Risser|risser]] 06:03, 9 March 2006 (PST)

:Here's the thing.  I don't like Various Artists as a sub-group of albums.  It looks dumb.  But, it doesn't make sense to have &quot;Compilations&quot; for single artist comps and also for multi-artist comps.  But, I was thinking, what about &quot;Collections&quot; for single artist comps, like greatest hits or box sets, and &quot;Compilations &amp; Soundtracks&quot; for multi-artist comps?  I like it, but it seems like an arbitrary distinction.  Anyone? --[[User:Risser|risser]] 07:40, 9 March 2006 (PST)

== Sorting ==

Which comes first?  Green Day or Adam Green (Green, Adam)?  Or, how would you order these: Green Day, Adam Green, Gary Green.  My initial take is GREEN, ADAM; GREEN, GARY; GREEN DAY, but I don't know for sure.  Part of the problem is, space comes before comma in the character set, so 'GREEN ' comes before 'GREEN,'.  Really, it probably doesn't matter too much because they'll all be in about the right place.  Still, any suggestions? --[[User:Risser|risser]] 20:08, 10 March 2006 (PST)

:I would go for leaving the comma off. --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 08:52, 11 March 2006 (PST)

:: So you're saying: Adam Green, Green Day, Gary Green? --[[User:Risser|risser]] 19:27, 12 March 2006 (PST)

::: '''Green Adam'''; '''Green Day'''; and '''Green Gary'''. --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 04:29, 13 March 2006 (PST)

::I believe you should link to them as their full name, but when applying the sorting to a link, you should probably type it as Green Gary or Green Adam.  Just leave the ',' out.

:::: I can go with that.  Again, they'll all be in the right area no matter what.  I'm just looking for consistency.  I'll add something to the front page. --[[User:Risser|risser]] 04:31, 13 March 2006 (PST)

== Wikipedia ==

Is there some way we could tie directly into the Wikipedia?  For most of the bands, they already have a comprehensive discography.  And if they don't, we could add one there.  If we could just use their existing links and add links from there to the Lyriki, we'd avoid the necessity of having the data in two places and having to copy it all over from there.  Does that make sense?  Just wondering. --[[User:Risser|risser]] 11:19, 15 March 2006 (PST)

:If Lyriki were truly a related project like wikibooks or wikiquotes upon which Wikipedia often refers people to for certain items.  That would make sense, but considering the seperated nature of Lyriki, it makes sense for Lyriki to have all the data neccessary to flesh out the articles on it's own.  My two cents :) --[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 13:03, 15 March 2006 (PST)

::I think band/artist biographical information should be removed from lyriki, and instead have a link to Wikipedia. As [[User:Risser|risser]] said, most bands allready have an article there. --[[User:Karma_Police|Karma_Police]] 19:56, 10 May 2006 (PST)


:Just gonna reiterate the above.  Lyriki -is not- a related project to wikipedia.  Whilst I don't believe the information (as has been the case for a few) should be copied word for word from wikipedia.  I do believe that any relevant information has a place here.  Lyriki should not have to depend on wikipedia, or any other source to complete it's content. --[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 20:44, 10 May 2006 (PDT)

Adding in [[Canada]] also brought another issue to light- some bands are gonna be in Wikipedia as Band_Name_(Band). And these tags don't work that way. There needs to be some way to override the automatic Wiki link if needed. (and if there is, tell editors about it.) --[[User:Charron|Charron]] 19:27, 18 December 2006 (PST)

:Ok, figured it out, but it should be more obvious on the help page. Yay or nay? --[[User:Charron|Charron]] 19:31, 18 December 2006 (PST)

:: You're right, it should be more obvious. The thing is, we need more people to get involved with these others aspects of the site. Everything here is a collaborative effort, not just adding song lyrics or artists information. --[[User:Attendant|Attendant]] 11:26, 19 December 2006 (PST)

:::I know, I know. *shame* :P --[[User:Charron|Charron]] 09:56, 20 December 2006 (PST)

== Short Discography Track Listing ==

It would be really nice for those of you who use the short discography to also make the album pages for the artist - at least add a track list; graphics and other information can be added at a later date. There are too many artists pages with just a listing of albums - this is pretty lazy and just makes someone else have to find all the track listings and do it themselves. So please when you're using the short discography, also make the album pages with a track listing, it just makes everything look much better, thanks :) --[[User:268229|268229]] 17:24, 15 March 2006 (PST)

: So, what you're saying is, you'd rather people didn't enter any data unless they enter all the data?  That doesn't make sense.  Any data uploaded is a step in a forward direction.  I welcome any and all additions, as long as they are reasonably correct. --[[User:Risser|risser]] 05:36, 16 March 2006 (PST)

::What I mean is that it would be better if there was more input when the artist page is created, it will allow for users to submit more lyrics without having to search for a track list as well. For example, if you're already doing an artist page, may as well take an extra minute to add a track listing as you you would practically already have the information while doing the artist page. Just a suggestion though ;) --[[User:268229|268229]] 14:56, 16 March 2006 (PST)

:::Can agree to this.  When I'm working on adding one particular album for an artist, I usually go ahead and add their complete Artist page/discography, because eventually I will complete it all (see [[Mest]] :P) It helps to 'shine a light down the title' so to speak, so the general public knows the page exists, but needs to be filled in :)  And, for new users, it's easier to use the red/no page exists link, and start typing out their lyrics, than adding, and linking songs with artists and songs.  I'm learning a lot, contributing to this site already. --[[User:Ahoier|ahoier]] 07:54, 27 May 2006 (PDT)

==How to implement single releases on artist page==
Hi folks,

i'm wondering about what would be the best way to include single releases onto the artist page.
I found different examples when searching for &quot;singles&quot;. 
First category implements song-links on the artist page, this can be found for example here:
[[3 Doors Down]] and here: [[H.I.M.]]
On the other hand there also used album-links like on: [[Mad Sin]], [[Wumpscut:]] or [[Olivia]]

My problem with the song-link version is, that you would have to add two links for the A and the B-side. As especially the B-sides are often the songs,
which don't appear on any album. The disadvantage of the album-link version is, that you have to create an extra album page for everey single, which will have
just 2 song-links (sometimes some more songs). So my question is, if we want to define a standard and if so, if the artis template should therefore contain a
singles (oder singles &amp; ep) section, so it es obvious which link to use.

Kind regards --[[User:Knufaz|Knufaz]] 12:21, 30 January 2009 (UTC)

==Categorization: Songs and Albums by Artis==
Hi,

on every album-page witch the C:Album Template you'll see &quot;Albums by xyz&quot; and on song pages using the C:Song Template you'll find likewise &quot;Songs by xyz&quot;. I really like these views and wonder wether these two points could be integrated into the C:Artis-Template. This way you may open an Artis Page an can directly navigate to its song and album-category. To my mind it shouldn't be much of a problem to add this to the C:Artist-Template, but i'm no wiki-expert.

Whats you opinion about that. Maybe a test-Artist Template could be of some use.

Kind regards

&lt;lyrics&gt;End of passion play, crumbling away
I'm your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear
Leading on your death's construction

Taste me, you will see
More is all you need
You're dedicated to
How I'm killing you

Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your master
Master

Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master
Master
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master
Master

Needlework the way, never you betray
Life of death becoming clearer
Pain monopoly, ritual misery
Chop your breakfast on a mirror

Taste me you will see
More is all you need
You're dedicated to
How I'm killing you

Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your master
Master

Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master
Master
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master
Master

Master, master
Where's the dreams that I've been after?
Master, master
You promised only lies
Laughter, laughter
All I hear and see is laughter
Laughter, laughter
Laughing at my cries
Fix me

Hell is worth all that, natural habitat
Just a rhyme without a reason
Never-ending maze, drift on numbered days
Now your life is out of season

I will occupy
I will help you die
I will run through you
Now I rule you, too

Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your master
Master

Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master
Master
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master
Master&lt;/lyrics&gt;

It's just one of their extended storybook like songs that actually has different parts but all as one track?  (Like 2012?) --[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 17:27, 30 December 2005 (PST)

:Yup, it's all one track, but is divided into subsongs in the track listing.  The first track on this album is 18 minutes. --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 17:32, 30 December 2005 (PST)</text>

&lt;lyrics&gt;
Health or wealth motherfucker
You fighting for else or self?
I write for dreams, fuck cream
Fill a empty shelf, tempt me your sorted

[Verse 1]
Crush this regime of hoarded wealth
Mix like Neapolitan ice cream
Learn to love the people and not just yourself
What is the culture of poverty?
What's up with these vultures robbing me?
I'll jump at the first chance to destroy these Monopolies
I'm no punk, I won't dance as a toy to appease
These parasitic fleas
I'm a bring this system right to it's fucking knees
I'm giving rhythm to Socialism see?
I'm driven to help the people, can't you understand G?
Whether you're with them or your with me
I'm a walk that walk, I'm a talk that talk
We can stand arm and arm and fight the cops
If I'm right, then you've lost

&quot;Who are you carrying all those bricks for? God?&quot;

[Verse 2]
Trapped like slaves, we're monkeys in a cage
As we reach this final stage in the maze
Words are mere oral phases and catchphrases
zero blazes, who ever snatch hate or praises?
I'm blowing ??? 
I'm showing up these racists
I be around when you come around
I got patience
Like the rarest thousand-year monsoon
I'm a recreate the Paris commune
inebriate under the full moon
To the plague, we've been born immune
A battle to win, or a drunken dream off Gin
Am I pumping cool eighteen again?
Mama didn't raise no fool-man
Since when did stupid become cool again?
Here come the real dog days
I feel some bad deals are coming way
Retarded rat, in circles, you're running
Acid rain, the sky is falling,
Yeah it's time to pay
No use in fighting!
&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;
It's the fall of Rome and buildings speed like a rolling stone
and soon the blind will see it's nothing like the past, world stock markets crash, 
gold is worthless, two dollars for wiping ass
Wars to no avail, the Bush ? Faces go pale
Pensions plans go bad, 
brokers are killing themselves, investors are going mad
China and Japan cash in their cash
It's all bad, Russia's going back Red
Gives Cuba ten billion right before Fidel is dead
One by one, looks like South America's going red
The US can't stop and see we fed them corruption not democracy, 
we gave them golden needs and not freedom and peace
It's time to destroy class
no more divisions among the mass
The systems will come crashing down
Making smiles out of the last frown
Bringing freedom to every last town
We blast clowns, it's capitalism we chant down
On our civil liberties they clamp down
No more bombing of my brothers and sisters
White, Red, Yellow, Black or Brown
Damn I'm pissed, I'm a marxist in a velvet fist
I was born with this gist
Telling the truth is always a risk
Close your eyes, hits like a punch or a kiss
&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;
[Intro: Zearle]
History is my world, if I started murdering people, there would be none left
If you spit in my face and smack me in the mouth and throw me in solitary confinement for nothing
What do you think's going to happen when I get out of here?



[Verse 1: Zearle]
I'm picking up these broken pieces
We're just monkeys throwing feces
Steady praying on your knees in weakness
We unfold religious creases
Like John Brown, ain't no way I let the shit go down
Fuck the rich, religion and those who wear the crown
More adjectives than nouns
Up we're tightly wound, frozen frowns
I can taste this hate
We can erase the rate
Waiting for no savior, with robe or camp
We don't believe in fate
Any future you got, you create
Way too wrapped up in religion to concentrate
Eyes bigger than belly and you got a full plate
Way too underground to be touched and these labels can't relate

[Verse 2: Mic Danja]
In this Class Struggle, ain't worth a damn
If I'm black and I'm poor, am I considered a man? (Maybe)
It's like war and baby, 
for me to get the information, I have to be Dick Tracy
Zearle, laced me, told me I have socialist opinions
than I realized he was right, rich folks tripping
No bullshit, whether it was written or shown on T.V.
If they can see that poverty is worth repeating
rich folks cheating, the support the institutions
What would they do if all criminals stopped shooting
Go bankrupt, you pay money so people pay ?
We still get credits and ? who think they made up
Trip to Vegas, or when we see them dock our pay cut, 
the working classmates, ? happen for a trip to Vegas

[Interlude: Zearle]
History is my world, remorse for what? You people have done everything in the world to me
Doesn't that give me equal rights?
If you spit in my face and smack me in the mouth and throw me in solitary confinement for nothing
What do you think's going to happen when I get out of here?

[Verse 3: Zearle]
All the rich are steady creeping
It's time to organize, are you ready for this meeting?
Against injustice, we fight in the streets and
We're burning up because we're ? the heat in
Shoulder to shoulder comrades, 
We march 'till ?
To the masses, fuck fashion, 
my folks are my passion
In my mind, revolution's flashing
We're serious, ? 
Unity, we wish
? they scatter like a broken dish
Money matters, 'till death plants a kiss
Like gypsies, we grift, drift and rift
Too many atrocities to list
Go to jail and slit your wrists
It's my philosophies like Christ
You'll never catch me, 
my hearts like an Apache
We punch through the social ?
Our emotions are painted blue
We have no clue
Childish ways that we outgrew
Our wildest days that we barely lived through
This world's a joke
Can't you see this yolk is choking me?
Capitalism, ? ? The Force ?
The rich say fuck the trees
???Players like a tees???
They then stole the honey, better fuck the bees
In the shade it's ninety-six degrees
I'll bust up ??? to get mine
To kill this giant, up the beanstalk we must climb
Fuck petty tyrants, a hundred million ain't afraid of dieing
For freedom we're ?
For freedom, need 'em. Money, jewellery, styling

[Verse 4: Mic Danja]
I know we hit hard
Explicit, you're so plain
Fuck the Government, the police, the ???soul??? racists
You want the basics
You want the average
Don't want the ???
They said we have shit
It's drastic
The devils out to get
Just give me your toys
and I'm a wish everybody's happy shit
I grew up a bastard with no father figure
My mom ???
Until her cancer killed her
Now, I'm a nigger
Responsible for what I do
I got my nephew, my brother
???class hit 'em too???
I got responsibilities; it's on my shoulder
It's not how much money you have; it's who's the holder

[Outro: Zearle]
Maybe I haven't done enough?
I might be ashamed of that, for not doing enough
For not giving enough
For not being more perceptive
For not being aware enough
For not understanding
For uh... being stupid
&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;
Uh, This is dedicated to all the hackers and the crackers
You know what I'm saying? If you hear this, I want you to bump this and do your dirt dog, do your dirt

[Verse 1]
You could fill a stadium with cats using shit cracked by Radium
Liquid Sky will never die
Before the crackers and the hackers, life was whacker
Software, we could never stack for 
We were floored by these evil whores
All the best shit we could never afford
The Internet and MP3, they set us free
I'm downloading Windows ME right now off FTP
You bitches will never find me
Because I'm everywhere, see
Yo dog, you got something new? 
Hit me off on ICQ
I'll help you back in Jive 
I got some top-notch shit on I Drive
You shut one site down, we multiply
Like a Phoenix, from a different place, we rise
Then you got the squares &quot;Yo dude, you're stealing, don't you care?&quot;
L-O-L bitch, I got a terabyte of warez
I like my files, SIT, ZIP or RAR
I'll download seven hundred segments from a thousand sites
I'll drink coffee, snort speed, I'll stay up all night
I'll hack your company’s site and blank it white
Ghost ISPs, find me, please.

This is dedicated to the hackers and crackers
This is dedicated to the hackers and crackers
The ones that set us free
Thanks chief for setting us free
This is dedicated to the hackers and crackers

[Verse 2]
I see in binary, I speak source code
Step on my toes I'll post a million .jpeg's
Of you in a fag pose
In your digital stance, getting fire walled ho
'Cause I'm riding the net in my 64
I was a dick with my 56
Now with my cable, I'm able to get that stable
On the out my name is Ace and I'm a Leo
On the digital highway, my name is Neo and I'm a hero
In a flash, I'll school you on burning DreamCast
You need some ISOs? Let me through my hard drive rifle
Our exchange you could never stifle
In a digital hug, you just caught the love bug
I bootlegged your CD
I caused the fight between UN and Jay-Z
You see G? It's all gonna be free
Whether we take it by force or we take it nicely
You feel that rattle in your bones?
When I tell you we just hacked DOW Jones?
And Nasdaq leaves you flat on your back
'Cause I am he who loves to hack and crack.
'Cause I am he who loves to hack and crack.

This is dedicated to the hackers and crackers
Serial Codes, Source Codes, ISOs, RARs, ZIPs, SITs, 
This is dedicated to the hackers and crackers

[Verse 3]
Your encryption is primitive Egyptian
I'll do more with a 486 and a Plextor
We've won when six billion got Athlons
and we tell each other how to get it on
Cyber armies, and the Pentagon we're storming
I just found out who killed J.F.K
The smoking gun will have it within a day
All the lies given faster
Go check the name &quot;truth&quot; on Napster
Digital disaster, the pricks, will never find me in this Matrix
A million keyboard voices all named Morpheus
This is dedicated to those who set me free
Got a buzz? You're always my cuz
Radium, if I could only say to them; thanks
Kalisto, you know!
Utopia, and all my digital dogs
My Net Dons, my Cyber Gangsters
My Wire Warriors, my Computer Comrades
This is for you, this is dedicated to the hackers and crackers (This is dedicated)
I wouldn't be able to do shit without y'all man (This is dedicated)
I'd be sitting in front of my fucking computer (This is dedicated)
Doing a god damn thing, playing games (This is dedicated)
Y'all made it possible (This is dedicated)
This is dedicated to you (This is dedicated)

Yo, (dedicated)
yo, (dedicated), yo
you send your vibes I'm sending my vibe out through this radio transmission
Send you out on your mission
Bring it down, hacking and cracking
Source Codes, Worms, ISOs, RARs, ZIPs, SITs, IRC
Can't you see me? (This is dedicated)
This is dedicated (This is dedicated)
This is dedicated (This is dedicated)
To the hackers and the crackers
This is dedicated (This is dedicated)
This is dedicated (This is dedicated)
To the hackers and the crackers
This is dedicated (This is dedicated)
This is dedicated (This is dedicated)
Uh, Uh
&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;[Chorus]
Fly away, fly away, fly away
Fly away, fly away, fly away

[Verse 1]
These people they have no substance
Love the trees ? the steeples take a tough stance
Hanging with the Earth people, we Ghost Dance
Prove our worth, last chance
Wake up from this hypnotic trance of high finance
You're lying as you glance over your shoulder
Driving through the Ghetto in your bullet-proof Rover
In the back, stuck by stiletto? Money lorded over
In a refugee camp, with three-hundred-thousand sleeping over
Time ain't nothing but shit getting older
We stab the eye of the beholderr
We grab the power back before the world gets any colder
Time women get a whack
They got to be better than these hacks
I'm walking off the beaten track
To make a plan of attack
I've been lower tracked
I'm a victim of this system
Disposable society,
Inhospitable reality
no nobility
What's the cause of our greed?
Feel pleased to succeed
Take heed, when you proceed, make your own decisions
Don't follow the stampede
Swallow their fallacies, you're playing petty bourgeoisie
How insane, CIA, imports cocaine cargo
While we still maintain, this bullshit Cuban Embargo, Uh

[Chorus]
Fly away, fly away, fly away
Fly away, fly away, fly away

[Verse 2]
No discussion, to the point I'm rushing
American born, but my family's Russian
Like an L.A. cop from the rampart division, I'm busted
Another snitch climb to the top. You should never have been trusted
At work, I'm given the shaft
watching' everybody else count their motherfucking cash
Never learn to dream in the long term
I need it fast, whether bling or blast
I'm flashing on the past
Disaster for the upper class
It's splendid, how do you take all these lies and blend it up?
Into a big cup of we're fucked
You got us dependent
We're all living in hell
it's how you spend it
You play so hard, I can't tell what's real and what's pretended
Sport that bourgeois broad, but she's dented
As we rise, you descended into the rich
There's principalities up in this shit, bitch
No holler, forced to live with no dollars
No scream, pray to god and have no means
Yeah, okay man, I'm a make it off this chain
Leave way more than my mark, I wanna stain
I better have my ticket for the fucking train
Fuck dames and fame, I'm a maker of rain
A prophecy that then came, out of the ashes of the flame
I'm shouting, hold fast and maintain
While you hold fast and get drained
My expression is pain, my expression is pain

[Chorus]
Fly away, fly away, fly away
Fly away, fly away, fly away
Fly away, fly away, fly away

[Verse 3]
No more poverty or sorrow
We cry away, we cry away
Our bills we die to pay, we die to pay
Sanity's slipping away, slipping away
All work no play. Down for the struggle like Che
I speak the words that you're afraid to say
We can still cope with this
The situation is not hopeless
Raise your voice and your fists
Guerrillas in the midst
No more handcuffs on my wrists
Fighting so hard, some people switch
The hunt is on, the truth has been construed
Our leaders have been subdued, unglued
As they feed us this genetically enhanced food
Like our ancestors with bodies are pierced and tattooed
Being under arrest ain't gonna save the rain forest
Ancient lands to us, to them fossil fuel treasure chests
We're unwelcome guests, stirring up the hornets’ nest
Creatures of the sea, no oil, free place to flee
Free, free, free.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Lashing out the action, returning the reaction
Weak are ripped and torn away
Hypnotizing power, crushing all that cower
Battery is here to stay

Smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Cannot kill the family, battery is found in me

Battery
Battery

Crushing all deceivers, mashing non-believers
Never-ending potency
Hungry violence-seeker feeding off the weaker
Breeding on insanity

Smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Cannot kill the family, battery is found in me

Battery
Battery

Circle of destruction, hammer comes crushing
Powerhouse of energy
Whipping up a fury, dominating flurry
We create the battery

Smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Cannot kill the family, battery is found in me

Battery&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Messenger of fear in sight
Dark deception kills the light

Hybrid children watch the sea
Pray for father, roaming free

Fearless wretch
Insanity
He watches
Lurking beneath the sea
Great old one
Forbidden site
He searches
Hunter of the shadows is rising
Immortal
In madness you dwell

Crawling chaos underground
Cult has summoned twisted sound

Out from ruins once possessed
Fallen city, living death

Fearless wretch
Insanity
He watches
Lurking beneath the sea
Timeless sleep
Has been upset
He awakens
Hunter of the shadows is rising
Immortal
In madness you dwell
In madness you dwell

Not dead which eternal lie
Stranger eons, death may die

Drain you of your sanity
Face the thing that should not be

Fearless wretch
Insanity
He watches
Lurking beneath the sea
Great old one
Forbidden site
He searches
Hunter of the shadows is rising
Immortal
In madness you dwell&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Welcome to where time stands still
No one leaves and no one will
Moon is full, never seems to change
Just labeled mentally deranged
Dream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors, no windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarred

Sleep, my friend, and you will see
That dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's why my brain says &quot;rage&quot;

Sanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone

Build my fear of what's out there
Cannot breathe the open air
Whisper things into my brain
Assuring me that I'm insane
They think our heads are in their hands
But violent use brings violent plans
Keep him tied, it makes him well
He's getting better, can't you tell?

No more can they keep us in
Listen, damn it, we will win
They see it right, they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hell

Sanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone
Sanitarium, just leave me alone

Fear of living on
Natives getting restless now
Mutiny in the air
Got some death to do
Mirror stares back hard
Kill, it's such a friendly word
Seems the only way
For reaching out again&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Bodies fill the fields I see, hungry heroes end
No one to play soldier now, no one to pretend
Running blind through killing fields, bred to kill them all
Victim of what said should be, a servant 'til I fall

Soldier boy, made of clay
Now an empty shell
Twenty-one, only son
But he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care
Do just as we say
Finished here. Greetings, Death,
He's yours to take away

Back to the front
You will do what I say, when I say
Back to the front
You will die when I say, you must die
Back to the front
You coward, you servant, you blind man

Barking of machine-gun fire does nothing to me now
Sounding of the clock that ticks, get used to it somehow
More a man, more stripes you wear, glory-seeker trends
Bodies fill the fields I see
The slaughter never ends

Soldier boy, made of clay
Now an empty shell
Twenty-one, only son
But he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care
Do just as we say
Finished here. Greetings, Death,
He's yours to take away

Back to the front
You will do what I say, when I say
Back to the front
You will die when I say, you must die
Back to the front
You coward, you servant, you blind man

Why am I dying?
Kill, have no fear
Lie, live off lying
Hell, hell is here

I was born for dying

Life planned out before my birth, nothing could I say
Had no chance to see myself, molded day by day
Looking back I realize, nothing have I done
Left to die with only friend
Alone I clench my gun

Soldier boy, made of clay
Now an empty shell
Twenty-one, only son
But he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care
Just do as we say
Finished here. Greetings, Death,
He's yours to take away

Back to the front
You will do what I say, when I say
Back to the front
You will die when I say, you must die
Back to the front
You coward, you servant, you blind man

Back to the front&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Spineless from the start
Sucked into the part
Circus comes to town
You play the lead clown

Please, please
Spreading his disease, living by his story
Knees, knees
Falling to your knees, suffer for his glory
You will

Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green, heaven you will meet
Make a contribution and you'll get the better seat

Bow to Leper Messiah

Marvel at his tricks
Need your Sunday fix
Blind devotion came
Rotting your brain

Chain, chain
Join the endless chain, taken by his glamour
Fame, fame
Infection is the game, stinking drunk with power
We see

Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green, heaven you will meet
Make a contribution and you'll get the better seat

Bow to Leper Messiah

Witchery, weakening
Sees the sheep are gathering
Set the trap, hypnotize
Now you follow

Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green, heaven you will meet
Make a contribution and you'll get the better seat

Lie&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Dealing out the agony within
Charging hard and no one's gonna give in
Living on your knees, conformity
Or dying on your feet for honesty
Inbred, our bodies work as one
Bloody, but never cry submission
Following our instinct, not a trend
Go against the grain until the end

Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
Damage, Incorporated

Slamming through, don't fuck with razorback
Stepping out? You'll feel our hell on your back
Blood follows blood and we make sure
Life ain't for you and we're the cure
Honesty is my only excuse
Try to rob us of it, but it's no use
Steamroller action crushing all
Victim is your name and you shall fall

Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
Damage, Incorporated


We chew and spit you out
We laugh, you scream and shout
All flee, with fear you run
You'll know just where we come from
Damage, Incorporated

Damage jackals ripping right through you
Sight and smell of this, it gets me going
Know just how to get just what we want
Tear it from your soul in nightly hunt
Fuck it all and fucking no regrets
Never happy endings on these dark sets
All's fair for Damage, Inc. you see
Step a little closer, if you please

Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
Damage, Incorporated&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Do unto others as they've done to you
But what the hell is this world coming to?
Blow the universe into nothingness
Nuclear warfare shall lay us to rest

Fight fire with fire
Ending is near
Fight fire with fire
Bursting with fear

We all shall die
Time is like a fuse, short and burning fast
Armageddon's here, like said in the past

Fight fire with fire
Ending is near
Fight fire with fire
Bursting with fear

Soon to fill our lungs, the hot winds of death
The gods are laughing, so take your last breath

Fight fire with fire
Ending is near
Fight fire with fire
Bursting with fear

Fight fire with fire

Fight&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Guilty as charged
But damn it, it ain't right
There's someone else controlling me
Death in the air
Strapped in the electric chair
This can't be happening to me

Who made you God to say,
&quot;I'll take your life from you&quot;?

Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flame

Wait for the sign
To flick the switch of death
It's the beginning of the end
Sweat, chilling cold
As I watch death unfold
Consciousness my only friend

My fingers grip with fear
What am I doing here?

Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flame

Someone help me
Oh please, God help me
They are trying to take it all away
I don't want to die

Time moving slow
The minutes seem like hours
The final curtain call I see
How true is this
Just get it over with
If this is true, just let it be

Wakened by horrid scream
Freed from this frightening dream

Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flame&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Life, it seems, will fade away
Drifting further every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters, no one else

I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me free

Things not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly lost, this can't be real
Cannot stand this hell I feel

Emptiness is filling me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness taking dawn
I was me, but now he's gone

No one but me can save myself, but it's too late
Now I can't think, think why I should even try

Yesterday seems as though it never existed
Death greets me warm, now I will just say goodbye&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I don't know how to live through this hell
Woken up, I'm still locked in this shell
Frozen soul, frozen down to the core
Break the ice, I can't take anymore

Freezing, can't move at all
Screaming, can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out
I'm trapped under ice

Crystallized as I lay here and rest
Eyes of glass stare directly at death
From deep sleep I have broken away
No one knows, no one hears what I say

Freezing, can't move at all
Screaming, can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out
I'm trapped under ice

Scream from my soul
Fate mystified
Hell forevermore

No release from my cryonic state
What is this? I've been stricken by fate
Wrapped up tight, cannot move, can't break free
Hand of doom has a tight grip on me

Freezing, can't move at all
Screaming, can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out
I'm trapped under ice&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Feel no pain, but my life ain't easy
I know I'm my best friend
No one cares, but I'm so much stronger
I'll fight until the end

To escape from the true false world
Undamaged destiny
Can't get caught in the endless circle
Ring of stupidity

Out for my own, out to be free
One with my mind, they just can't see
No need to hear things that they say
Life's for my own, to live my own way

Rape my mind and destroy my feelings
Don't tell me what to do
I don't care now 'cause I'm on my side
And I can see through you

Feed my brain with your so-called standards
Who says that I ain't right?
Break away from your common fashion
See through your blurry sight

Out for my own, out to be free
One with my mind, they just can't see
No need to hear things that they say
Life's for my own, to live my own way

See them try to bring the hammer down
No damn chains can hold me to the ground

Life's for my own, to live my own way
Life's for my own, to live my own way&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Slaves
Hebrews born to serve, to the pharaoh
Heed
To his every word, live in fear
Faith
Of the unknown one, the deliverer
Wait
Something must be done, four hundred years

So let it be written, so let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written, so let it be done
To kill the first-born pharaoh son
I'm creeping death

Now
Let my people go, land of Goshen
Go
I will be with thee, bush of fire
Blood
Running red and strong down the Nile
Plague
Darkness three days long, hail to fire

So let it be written, so let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written, so let it be done
To kill the first-born pharaoh son
I'm creeping death

Die by my hand
I creep across the land
Killing first-born man

Die by my hand
I creep across the land
Killing first-born man

I
Rule the midnight air, the destroyer
Born
I shall soon be there, deadly mass
I
Creep the steps and floor, final darkness
Blood
Lamb's blood painted door, I shall pass

So let it be written, so let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written, so let it be done
To kill the first-born pharaoh son
I'm creeping death&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Say your prayers, little one
Don't forget, my son,
To include everyone

I tuck you in, warm within
Keep you free from sin
Till the sandman he comes

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit: light
Enter: night
Take my hand
We're off to never-never land

Something's wrong, shut the light
Heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White

Dreams of war, dreams of liars
Dreams of dragon's fire
And of things that will bite

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit: light
Enter: night
Take my hand
We're off to never-never land

Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I die before I wake
Pray the Lord my soul to take

Hush little baby, don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beasts under your bed
In your closet, in your head

Exit: light
Enter: night
Grain of sand

Exit: light
Enter: night
Take my hand
We're off to never-never land&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Hey, I'm your life
I'm the one who takes you there
Hey, I'm your life
I'm the one who cares

They, they betray
I'm your only true friend now
They, they'll betray
I'm forever there

I'm your dream, make you real
I'm your eyes when you must steal
I'm your pain when you can't feel
Sad but true

I'm your dream, mind astray
I'm your eyes while you're away
I'm your pain while you repay
You know it's sad but true

Sad but true

You, you're my mask
You're my cover, my shelter
You, you're my mask
You're the one who's blamed

Do, do my work
Do my dirty work, scapegoat
Do, do my deeds
For you're the one who's shamed

I'm your dream, make you real
I'm your eyes when you must steal
I'm your pain when you can't feel
Sad but true

I'm your dream, mind astray
I'm your eyes while you're away
I'm your pain while you repay
You know it's sad but true

Sad but true


I'm your dream
I'm your eyes
I'm your pain

I'm your dream
I'm your eyes
I'm your pain
You know it's sad but true

Hate, I'm your hate
I'm your hate when you want love
Pay, pay the price
Pay, for nothing's fair

Hey, I'm your life
I'm the one who took you here
Hey, I'm your life
And I no longer care

I'm your dream, make you real
I'm your eyes when you must steal
I'm your pain when you can't feel
Sad but true

I'm your truth, telling lies
I'm your reasoned alibis
I'm inside, open your eyes
I'm you

Sad but true&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;No more
The crap rolls out your mouth again
Haven't changed, your brain is still gelatin
Little whispers circle around your head
Why don't you worry about yourself instead?

Who are you? Where ya been? Where ya from?
Gossip burning on the tip of your tongue
You lie so much you believe yourself
Judge not lest ye be judged yourself

Holier than thou
You are
Holier than thou
You are

You know not

Before you judge me, take a look at you
Can't you find something better to do?
Point the finger, slow to understand
Arrogance and ignorance go hand in hand

It's not who you are, it's who you know
Others' lives are the basis of your own
Burn your bridges and build them back with wealth
Judge not lest ye be judged yourself

Holier than thou
You are
Holier than thou
You are

You know not

Who the hell are you?&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;New blood joins this earth
And quickly he's subdued
Through constant pained disgrace
The young boy learns their rules

With time, the child draws in
This whipping boy done wrong
Deprived of all his thoughts
The young man struggles on and on, he's known
A vow unto his own
That never from this day
His will they'll take away

What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be
Never see

Won't see what might have been

What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free
Never me
So I dub thee &quot;Unforgiven&quot;

They dedicate their lives
To running all of his
He tries to please them all
This bitter man he is

Throughout his life the same
He's battled constantly
This fight he cannot win
A tired man they see no longer cares
The old man then prepares
To die regretfully
That old man here is me

What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be
Never see
Won't see what might have been

What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free
Never me
So I dub thee &quot;Unforgiven&quot;

You labeled me
I'll label you
So I dub thee &quot;Unforgiven&quot;&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;…And the road becomes my bride
I have stripped of all but pride
So in her I do confide
And she keeps me satisfied
Gives me all I need

…And with dust in throat I crave
Only knowledge will I save
To the game you stay a slave
Rover, wanderer
Nomad, vagabond
Call me what you will

But I'll take my time anywhere
Free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll redefine anywhere

Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home

…And the earth becomes my throne
I adapt to the unknown
Under wandering stars I've grown
By myself but not alone
I ask no one

...And my ties are severed clean
The less I have, the more I gain
Off the beaten path I reign
Rover, wanderer
Nomad, vagabond
Call me what you will

But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll never mind anywhere

Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home

But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind
And I'll take my find anywhere

Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home

Carved upon my stone
My body lie, but still I roam
Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may roam&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Liberty or death, what we so proudly hail
Once you provoke her, rattling of her tail
Never begins it, never, but once engaged
Never surrenders, showing the fangs of rage

Don't tread on me

So be it
Threaten no more
To secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it
Settle the score
Touch me again for the words that you will hear evermore

Don't tread on me

Love it or live it, she with the deadly bite
Quick is the blue tongue, forked as the lighting strike
Shining with brightness, always on surveillance
The eyes, they never close, emblem of vigilance

Don't tread on me

So be it
Threaten no more
To secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it
Settle the score
Touch me again for the words that you will hear evermore

Don't tread on me

So be it
Threaten no more
To secure peace is to prepare for war

Liberty or death, what we so proudly hail
Once you provoke her, rattling
of her tail

So be it
Threaten no more
To secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it
Settle the score
Touch me again for the words that you will hear evermore

Don't tread on me&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;All that is, was and will be
Universe much too big to see

Time and space never ending
Disturbing thoughts, questions pending
Limitations of human understanding
Too quick to criticize
Obligation to survive
We hunger to be alive

All that is, ever
Ever was
Will be ever
Twisting
Turning
Through the never

In the dark, see past our eyes
Pursuit of truth no matter where it lies

Gazing up to the breeze of the heavens
On a quest, meaning, reason
Came to be, how it begun
All alone in the family of the sun
Curiosity teasing everyone
On our home, third stone from the sun

All that is, ever
Ever was
Will be ever
Twisting
Turning
Through the never

On through the never
We must go
On through the never
Out to the
Edge of forever
We must go
On through the never
Then never comes

All that is, ever
Ever was
Will be ever
Twisting
Turning
Who we are
Ask forever
Twisting
Turning
Through the never

Never&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;So close no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters

Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know

So close no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know

Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters

Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they say
Never cared for games they play
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
And I know

So close no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
No, nothing else matters&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Off through the new day's mist I run
Out from the new day's mist I have come
I hunt
Therefore I am
Harvest the land
Taking of the fallen lamb

Off through the new day's mist I run
Out from the new day's mist I have come
We shift
Pulsing with the earth
Company we keep
Roaming the land while you sleep

Shape shift, nose to the wind
Shape shift, feeling I've been
Move swift, all senses clean
Earth's gift, back to the meaning of life

Bright is the moon, high in starlight
Chill in the air, cold as steel tonight
We shift
Call of the wild
Fear in your eyes
It's later than you realized

Shape shift, nose to the wind
Shape shift, feeling I've been
Move swift, all senses clean
Earth's gift, back to the meaning of life

I feel a change
Back to a better day
Hair stands on the back of my neck
In wildness is the preservation of the world
So seek the wolf in thyself

Shape shift, nose to the wind
Shape shift, feeling I have been
Move swift, all senses clean
Earth's gift
Back to the meaning of wolf and man&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Pride you took
Pride you feel
Pride that you felt when you'd kneel

Not the word
Not the love
Not what you thought from above

It feeds
It grows
It clouds all that you will know
Deceit
Deceive
Decide just what you believe

I see faith in your eyes
Never you hear the discouraging lies
I hear faith in your cries
Broken is the promise, betrayal
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail
Follow the god that failed

Find your peace
Find your say
Find the smooth road on your way

Trust you gave
A child to save
Left you cold and him in grave

It feeds
It grows
It clouds all that you will know
Deceit
Deceive
Decide just what you believe
I see faith in your eyes
Never you hear the discouraging lies
I hear faith in your cries
Broken is the promise, betrayal
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail
Follow the god that failed

I see faith in your eyes
Broken is the promise, betrayal
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail
Follow the god that failed

Pride you took
Pride you feel
Pride that you felt when you'd kneel

Trust you gave
A child to save
Left you cold and him in grave

I see faith in your eyes
Never you hear the discouraging lies
I hear faith in your cries
Broken is the promise, betrayal
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail
Follow the god that failed
Follow the god that failed
Broken is the promise, betrayed
Betrayal&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;You just stood there screaming
Fearing no one was listening to you
They say the empty can rattles the most
The sound of your own voice must soothe you
Hearing only what you want to hear
And knowing only what you've heard
You, you're smothered in tragedy
And you're out to save the world

Misery
You insist that the weight of the world
Should be on your shoulders
Misery
There's much more to life than what you see
My friend of misery

You still stood there screaming
No one caring about these words you tell
My friend, before your voice is gone
One man's fun is another's hell
These times are sent to try men's souls
But something's wrong with all you see
You, you'll take it on all yourself
Remember, misery loves company

Misery
You insist that the weight of the world
Should be on your shoulders
Misery
There's much more to life than what you see
My friend of misery

You just stood there screaming
My friend of misery&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Reaching out for something you've got to feel
While clutching to what you had thought was real

Kicking at a dead horse pleases you
No way of showing your gratitude
So many things you don't want to do
What is it? What have you got to lose?

What the hell?
What is it you think you're gonna find?
Hypocrite
Boredom sets into the boring mind

Struggle within, it suits you fine
Struggle within, your ruin
Struggle within, you seal your own coffin
Struggle within, the struggling within

Home is not a home, it becomes a hell
Turning it into your prison cell
Advantages are taken, not handed out
While you struggle inside your hell

Reaching out
Grabbing for something you've got to feel
Closing in
The pressure upon you is so unreal

Struggle within, it suits you fine
Struggle within, your ruin
Struggle within, you seal your own coffin
Struggle within, struggling within

Struggle

Reaching out for something you've got to feel
While clutching to what you had thought was real

What the hell?
What is it you think you're gonna find?
Hypocrite
Boredom sets into the boring mind

Struggle within, it suits you fine
Struggle within, your ruin
Struggle within, you seal your own coffin
Struggle within, struggling within&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Gimme fuel, gimme fire
Gimme that which I desire

Turn on, I see red
Adrenaline crash and crack my head
Nitro junkie, paint me dead
And I see red

One hundred plus through black and white
War horse, warhead
Fuck 'em, man, white-knuckle tight
Through black and white

On I burn
Fuel is pumping engines
Burning hard, loose and clean
And on I burn
Churning my direction
Quench my thirst with gasoline

So gimme fuel, gimme fire
Gimme that which I desire

Turn on beyond the bone
Swallow future, spit out home
Burn your face upon the chrome

Take the corner, join the crash,
Headlights, head on, headlines
Another junkie lives too fast
Lives way too fast

On I burn
Fuel is pumping engines
Burning hard, loose and clean
And on I burn
Churning my direction
Quench my thirst with gasoline

So gimme fuel, gimme fire
Gimme that which I desire

White-knuckle tight

Gimme fuel
Gimme fire
My desire

On I burn
Fuel is pumping engines
Burning hard, loose and clean
And on I burn
Churning my direction
Quench my thirst with gasoline

Gimme fuel, gimme fire
Gimme that which I desire

On I burn&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Fortune, fame
Mirror vain
Gone insane
But the memory remains

Heavy rings on fingers wave
Another star denies the grave
See the nowhere crowd cry the nowhere cheers of honor

Like twisted vines that grow
Hide and swallow mansions whole
And dim the light of an already faded prima donna

Fortune, fame
Mirror vain
Gone insane
Fortune, fame
Mirror vain
Gone insane
But the memory remains

Heavy rings hold cigarettes
Up to lips that time forgets
While the Hollywood sun sets behind your back

And can't the band play on?
Just listen, they play my song
Ash to ash, dust to dust, fade to black

Fortune, fame
Mirror vain
Gone insane
Fortune, fame
Mirror vain
Gone insane
Dance, little tin goddess

Drift away
Fade away
Little tin goddess

Ash to ash
Dust to dust
Fade to black

Fortune, fame
Mirror vain
Gone insane
Fortune, fame
Mirror vain
Gone insane
But the memory remains

Ash to ash
Dust to dust
Fade to black
But the memory remains

To this faded prima donna

Dance, little tin goddess, dance&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I feel you too
Feel those things you do
In your eyes I see a fire that burns
To free the you
That's wanting through
Deep inside you know the seeds I plant will grow

One day you will see
And dare to come down to me
C'mon, c'mon now take the chance
That's right, let's dance

Snake, I am the snake
Tempting, that bite to take
Let me make your mind
Leave yourself behind
Be not afraid
I've got what you need
Hunger I will feed

One day you will see
And dare to come down to me
C'mon, c'mon now take the chance
Come dance

One day you will see
And dare to come down to me
C'mon, c'mon now take the chance


I feel you too
Feel those things you do
In your eyes I see a fire that burns
To free the you
That's running through
Deep inside you know
Seeds I plant will grow

One day you will see
And dare to come down to me
C'mon, c'mon now take the chance
That's right
Let's dance

It's nice to see you here&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Lay beside me, tell me what they've done
Speak the words I want to hear, to make my demons run
The door is locked now but it's opened if you're true
If you can understand me, then I can understand you

Lay beside me, under wicked skies
Through black of day, dark of night, we share this pair of lives
The door cracks open but there's no sun shining through
Black heart scarring darker still, but there's no sun shining through

No, there's no sun shining through
No, there's no sun shining

What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?

What I've felt, what I've known
Sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there, 'cause I'm the one who waits for you
Or, are you unforgiven too?

Come lay beside me, this won't hurt, I swear
She loves me not, she loves me still, but she'll never love again
She lay beside me but she'll be there when I'm gone
Black heart scarring darker still, yes, she'll be there when I'm gone

Yes, she'll be there when I'm gone
Dead sure she'll be there

What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn to stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?

What I've felt, what I've known
Sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there, 'cause I'm the one who waits for you
Or, are you unforgiven too?

Lay beside me, tell me what I've done
The door is closed, so are your eyes
But now I see the sun, now I see the sun
Yes, now I see it

What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?

What I've felt, what I've known
Sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there? 'Cause I'm the one who waits
The one who waits for you

I take this key
And I bury it in you
Because you're unforgiven too

Never free
Never me
'Cause you're unforgiven too&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I look at you, then you, me
Hungry and thirsty are we
Holding the lion's share, holding the key
Holding me back 'cause I'm striving to be

Better than you
Better than you

Lock horns, I push and I strive
Somehow I feel more alive
Bury the need for it, bury the seed
Bury me deep when there's no will to be

Better than you
Better than you

Can't stop this train from rolling
Nothing brings me down
No, can't stop this train from rolling on and on, on
Forever on and on

Can't stop this train from rolling
You can't take it down
No, never stop this locomotion, on and on and on
No, you can't bring me down 'cause I'm

Better than you
Better than you&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Don't go looking for snakes, you might find them
Don't send your eyes to the sun, you might blind them
Haven't I seen you here before?

Watch the puppets dancing
See the clowns fall down
Tie your tap shoes tightly

And wear them into town

See you crawlin'
See you crawlin' in

Don't go looking for snakes, you might find them
Don't send your eyes to the sun, you might blind them
Haven't I seen you here before?
There ain't no heroes here, no, no more

Play the game so nicely
Check, it's your move now
We're standing in this jungle
With serpents I have found

See you crawlin'
See you crawlin' in

Don't go looking for snakes, you might find them
Don't send your eyes to the sun, you might blind them
Haven't I seen you here before?
Have your heroes disappeared?

See you crawlin'
See you crawlin' in

So don't go looking for snakes, you might find them
Don't send your eyes to the sun, you might blind them
Haven't I seen you here before?
No, there ain't no heroes here, no

Haven't I seen you here before?
No there ain't no heroes here

Don't go looking for snakes, you might find them
Haven't I seen you here before?
Have your heroes disappeared?
Don't send your eyes to the sun, you might blind them&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Hit dirt
Shake tree
Split sky
Part sea

Strip smile
Lose cool
Bleed the day
And break the rule

Live, win
Dare, fail
Eat the dirt
And bite the nail

Then make me miss you
Then make me miss you

So wash your face away with dirt
It don't feel good until it hurts
So take this world and shake it
Come squeeze and suck the day
Come carpe diem, baby

Draw lead
Piss wine
Sink teeth
All mine

Stoke fire
Break neck
Suffer through this
Cheat on death

Hug the curve
Lose the time
Tear the map
And shoot the sign

Then make me miss you
Then make me miss you

So wash your face away with dirt
It don't feel good until it hurts
So take this world and shake it
Come squeeze and suck the day
Come carpe diem, baby

Live, win
Dare, fail
Eat dirt
Bite the nail

Strip smile
Lose cool
Bleed the day
And break the rule

Hug the curve
Lose the time
Tear the map
And shoot the sign

Then make me miss you
Then make me miss you

So wash your face away with dirt
It don't feel good until it hurts
So take this world and shake it
Come squeeze and suck the day

Come make me miss you
Come carpe diem, baby
Come carpe diem, baby&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Come clean, fess up
Tell all, spill gut
Off the veil, stand revealed
Show the cards, bring it on, break the seal

Ladies and gentlemen,
step right up
And see the man who told
the truth

Swing the noose again
Pierce the apple skin
You bit more than you need
Now you're choking on
the bad seed
On the bad seed
Choking

Let on, load off
Confess, cast off
At the mercy, the cat is out
Drop the disguise, spit it up,
spit it out

And now, what you've all
been waiting for
I give you He Who Suffers
the Truth

Swing the noose again
Pierce the apple skin
You bit more than you need
Now you're choking on the
bad seed
Choking on the bad seed

Off the veil, stand revealed
Bring it on, break the seal
At the mercy, cat is out
Spit it up, spit it out
Spit it up, spit it out
Spit it out now

At the mercy

Swing the noose again
Pierce the apple skin
You bit more than you need
Choking on the seed

Swing the noose again
Pierce the apple skin
You bit more than you need
You're choking on the bad seed

Off the veil, stand revealed
Bring it on, break the seal
At the mercy, cat is out
Spit it up, spit it out
Spit it up, spit it out
Spit it out now

Choking on the bad seed&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;So wake up, sleepy one
It's time to save your world

Steal dreams and give to you
Shoplift a thought or two
All children touch the sun
Burn fingers one by one, by one

Will this earth be good to you?
Keep you clean or stain through?

So wake up, sleepy one
It's time to save your world
You're where the wild things are
Toy soldiers off to war

Big eyes to open soon
Believing all under sun and moon
But does heaven know you're here?
And did they give you smiles or tears?
No, no tears

Will this earth be good to you?
Keep you clean or stain through?

So wake up, sleepy one
It's time to save your world
You're where the wild things are
Toy soldiers off to war

You swing your rattle down
Call to arms, the trumpets sound
Toy horses start the charge
Robot chessmen standing guard

Hand puppets storm the beach
Fire trucks trapped out of reach
Hand puppets storm the beach
Fire trucks trapped out of reach
All clowns reinforce the rear
Slingshots fire into the air
All clowns reinforce the rear
Slingshots fire into the air
Stuffed bears hold the hill till death
Crossfire from the marionettes
Stuffed bears hold the hill till death
Crossfire from the marionettes
We shall never surrender

All you children touch the sun
Burn your fingers one by one
Will this earth be good to you?
Keep you clean or stain through?

So wake up, sleepy one
It's time to save your world
You're where the wild things are
Toy soldiers off to war
Off to war
Off to war

So close your little eyes&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;There's a black cloud overhead
That's me
And the poison ivy chokes the tree
Again it's me
I'm the filthy one on Bourbon Street you walk on by
I'm the little boy that pushes hard and makes it cry

There's a dirty needle in your child
Stick me
Empty bottles still in hand, still dead
Still me
I'm the suit and tie that bleeds the street and still wants more
I'm the forty-five that's in your mouth, I'm a dirty, dirty whore

Look, it's me
The one who can't be free
Much too young to focus
But too old to see

Hey, look, it's me
What no one wants to see
See what you brought this world
Just what you want to see
Hey, Ma
Hey, Mom! Look, it's me

And he wants to be called “Father” now
Me again, me
The marks inside your arms spell me
Spell only me
I'm the nothing face that plants the bomb and strolls away
I'm the one who doesn't look quite right as children play

Look, it's me
The one who can't be free
Much too young to focus
But too old to see

Hey, look, it's me
What no one wants to see
See what you brought this world
Just what you want you want to see
Hey, Ma
Hey, Ma! Look, it's me

Look up to me,
What to be and what to fear
Look up to me
Look, it's me. Like what you hear?
See right through me
See the one who can't be free
See right through me
Look, it's me, what no one wants to see

Now see the black cloud up ahead
That's me
And this poison ivy chokes the tree
Again it's me
And I'm the filthy one on Bourbon Street you walk on by
I'm the little boy that pushes, pushes, makes it cry

Look, it's me
The one who can't be free
Much too young to focus
But too old to see

Hey, look, it's me
What no one wants to see
See what you brought this world
Just what you want to see
Hey, Ma
Hey, Ma! Look, it's me

Hey, Ma
Hey, Ma! Look, it's me&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;My eyes seek reality
My fingers seek my veins
There's a dog at your back step
He must come in from the rain

I fall 'cause I've let go
The net below has rot away
So my eyes seek reality
And my fingers seek my veins

The trash fire is warm
But nowhere safe from the storm
And I can't bear to see
What I've let me be
So wicked and worn

So as I write to you
Of what is done and to do
Maybe you'll understand
And you won't cry for this man
'Cause low man is due

Please forgive me

My eyes seek reality
My fingers feel for faith
Touch clean with a dirty hand
I touch the clean to the waste

The trash fire is warm
But nowhere safe from the storm
And I can't bear to see
What I've let me be
So wicked and worn

So as I write to you
Of what is done and to do
Maybe you'll understand
And won't cry for this man
'Cause low man is due
Please forgive me

So low, the sky is all I see
All I want from you is forgive me
So you bring this poor dog in from the rain
Though he just wants right back out again

And I cry to the alleyway
Confess all to the rain
But I lie, lie straight to the mirror
The one I've broken to match my face

The trash fire is warm
But nowhere safe from the storm
And I can't bear to see
What I've let me be
So wicked and worn

So as I write to you
Of what is done and to do
Maybe you'll understand
And won't cry for this man
'Cause low man is due

Please forgive me

So low, the sky is all I see
All I want from you is forgive me
So you bring this poor dog in from the rain
Though he just wants right back out again

My eyes seek reality
My fingers seek my veins&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Suppose I say &quot;I'm never satisfied&quot;
Suppose I say &quot;You cut some root to make the tree survive&quot;

Just let me kill you for a while
Just let me kill you for a smile
Just let me kill you once
I'm oh so bored to death

I hunger
I hunger
I eat

Born into attitude
Asleep at the wheel
Throw all your bullets in the fire
And run like hell
Why cure the fever?
Whatever happened to sweat?

Suppose I say &quot;The vultures smile at me&quot;
Suppose I say &quot;I've sent them down and they plan to pick you clean&quot;

And satisfaction this way comes
And satisfaction this way comes
And satisfaction's here and gone, gone
Gone again

I hunger
I hunger
I eat

Born into attitude
Asleep at the wheel
Throw all your bullets in the fire
And stand there

Born into attitude
Twist mother tongue
Throw all your bullets in the fire
And run like hell
Why cure the fever?
Whatever happened to sweat?

Just let me kill you for a while
Just let me kill you for a smile
Just let me kill you once for me
I'm bored to death

And satisfaction this way comes
And satisfaction this way comes
And satisfaction's here and
gone, gone
Gone again

I hunger
I hunger
I eat

Born into attitude
Asleep at the wheel
Throw all your bullets in the fire
And stand there

Born into attitude
Twist mother tongue
Throwing all your bullets in the fire
And run like hell
Why cure the fever?
Whatever happened to sweat?&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Dolls of voodoo all stuck with pins
One for each of us and our sins
So you lay us in a line
Push the pins in and make us humble
Only you can tell in time,
If we fall or merely stumble

But tell me, can you heal what father's done
Or fix this hole in mother's son
Can you heal the broken worlds within
Can you strip away so we may start again
Tell me, can you heal what father's done
Or cut this rope and let us run
Just when all seems fine and I'm pain free
Jab another pin, jab another pin in me

Mirror, mirror upon that wall
Break this spell or become the doll
See you sharpening the pins
So the holes would remind us
We're just the toys of the hands of another
And in time, the needles turn from shine to rust

But tell me, can you heal what father's done
Or fix this hole in mother's son
Can you heal the broken worlds within
Can you strip away so we may start again
Tell me, can you heal what father's done
Or cut this rope and let us run
Just when all seems fine and I'm pain free
Jab another pin, jab another pin in me

Blood for face, sweat for dirt
Three X's for the stone
To break this curse, a ritual's due
I believe I'm not alone
Shell of shotgun, pint of gin
Numb us up to shield the pins
Renew our faith which way can
To fall in love with life again
To fall in love with life again
To fall in love, to fall in love, to fall in love with life again

So tell me, can you heal what father's done
Or fix this hole in mother's son
Can you heal the broken worlds within
Can you strip away so we may start again
Yeah, tell me, can you heal what father's done
Or cut this rope and let us run
Just when all seems fine and I'm pain free
Jab another pin, jab another pin in me

No more pins in me
No more, no more pins in me
No more, no more pins in me
No more, no more, no, no, no&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go
A little high, little low
Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooo
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody - I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooo - (anyway the wind blows)
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouch, scaramouch will you do the fandango
Thunderbolt and lightning - very very frightening me
Gallileo, Gallileo
Gallileo, Gallileo
Gallileo Figaro - magnifico

But I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come easy go - will you let me go
Bismillah! No - we will not let you go - let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go - let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go - let me go
Will not let you go - let me go (never)
Never let you go - let me go
Never let me go - ooo
No, no, no, no, no, no, no -
Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me
For me
For me

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh baby - can't do this to me baby
Just gotta get out - just gotta get right outta here

Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Nothing really matters
Anyone can see
Nothing really matters - nothing really matters to me

Anyway the wind blows...&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;She keeps her Moet and Chandon
In a pretty cabinet
'Let them eat cake' she says
Just like Marie Antoinette
A built-in remedy
For Kruschev and Kennedy
At anytime an invitation
You can't decline

Caviar and cigarettes
Well versed in etiquette
Extraordinarily nice

She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatin
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime
Ooh, recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try?

To avoid complications
She never kept the same address
In conversation
She spoke just like a baroness
Met a man from China
Went down to Geisha Minah
(killer, killer, she's a Killer Queen)
Then again incidentally
If you're that way inclined

Perfume came naturally from Paris (naturally)
For cars she couldn't care less
Fastidious and precise

She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatin
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime

Drop of a hat she's as willing as
Playful as a pussy cat
Then momentarily out of action
Temporarily out of gas
To absolutely drive you wild, wild...
She's all out to get you

She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatin
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime

Ooh, recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try?
You wanna try...&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Are you gonna take me home tonight ?
Ah down beside that red firelight
Are you gonna let it all hang out ?
Fat bottomed girls
You make the rockin' world go round

Hey I was just a skinny lad
Never knew no good from bad
But I knew life before I left my nursery - huh
Left alone with big fat Fanny
She was such a naughty nanny
Heap big woman you made a bad boy out of me
Hey hey!

I've been singing with my band
Across the wire across the land
I seen every blue eyed floozy on the way, hey
But their beauty and their style
Went kind of smooth after a while
Take me to them dirty ladies everytime

C'mon
Oh won't you take me home tonight ?
Oh down beside your red firelight
Oh and you give it all you got
Fat bottomed girls you make the rockin' world go round
Fat bottomed girls you make the rockin' world go round

Hey listen here
Now I got mortgages on homes
I got stiffness in ma' bones
Ain't no beauty queens in this locality (I tell ya)
Oh but I still get my pleasure
Still get my greatest treasure
Heap big woman you done made a big man out of me

Now get this
Oh (I know) you gonna take me home tonight (please)
Oh down beside that red firelight
Are you gonna let it all hang out ?
Fat bottomed girls you make the rockin' world go round yeah
Fat bottomed girls you make the rockin' world go round

Get on your bikes and ride
Ooh yeah oh yeah them fat bottomed girls
Fat bottomed girls
Yeah yeah yeah
Alright, ride 'em cowboy
Fat bottomed girls - yes yes&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Ooh you make me live
Whatever this world can give to me
It's you you're all I see
Ooo you make me live now honey
Ooo you make me live

Ooh you're the best friend that I ever had
I've been with you such a long time
You're my sunshine and I want you to know
That my feelings are true
I really love you
Oh you're my best friend

Ooo you make me live

Ooh I've been wandering round
But I still come back to you
In rain or shine
You've stood by me, girl
I'm happy at home
You're my best friend

Ooo you make me live
Whenever this world is cruel to me
I got you to help me forgive
Ooo you make me live now honey
Ooo you make me live

You're the first one
When things turn out bad
You know I'll never be lonely
You're my only one
And I love the things
I really love the things that you do
You're my best friend

Ooo you make me live

I'm happy at home
You're my best friend
Oh
Oh you're my best friend
Ooo you make me live
You you're my best friend&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Tonight I'm gonna have myself a real good time
I feel alive and the world I'll turn it inside out - yeah
And floating around in ecstasy
So don't stop me now don't stop me
'Cause I'm having a good time having a good time

I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky
Like a tiger defying the laws of gravity
I'm a racing car passing by like Lady Godiva
I'm gonna go go go
There's no stopping me

I'm burnin' through the sky yeah
Two hundred degrees
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm trav'ling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you

Don't stop me now I'm having such a good time
I'm having a ball
Don't stop me now
If you wanna have a good time just give me a call
Don't stop me now ('Cause I'm having a good time)
Don't stop me now (Yes I'm havin' a good time)
I don't want to stop at all

Yeah, I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars
On a collision course
I am a satellite I'm out of control
I am a sex machine ready to reload
Like an atom bomb about to
Oh oh oh oh oh explode

I'm burnin' through the sky yeah
Two hundred degrees
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm trav'ling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic woman of you

Don't stop me don't stop me
Don't stop me hey hey hey
Don't stop me don't stop me
Ooh ooh ooh, I like it
Don't stop me don't stop me
Have a good time good time
Don't stop me don't stop me ah
Oh yeah
Alright

Oh, I'm burnin' through the sky yeah
Two hundred degrees
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm trav'ling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you

&lt;lyrics&gt;It started off so well
They said we made a perfect pair
I clothed myself in your glory and your love
How I loved you
How I cried
The years of care and loyalty
Were nothing but a sham it seems
The years belie we lived the lie
&quot;I love you 'til I die&quot;

Save me, Save me, Save me
I can't face this life alone
Save me Save me Save me
I'm naked and I'm far from home

The slate will soon be clean
I'll erase the memories
To start again with somebody new
Was it all wasted
All that love ?
I hang my head and I advertise
A soul for sale or rent
I have no heart, I'm cold inside
I have no real intent

Save me, Save me, Save me
I can't face this life alone
Save me Save me
Oh I'm naked and I'm far from home

Each night I cry and still believe the lie
I love you 'til I die

(Save me, Save me, Save me)
Yea, yeah
Save me yeah Save me oh Save me
Don't let me face my life alone
Save me, Save me
Oh I'm naked and I'm far from home&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;This thing called love I just can't handle it
This thing called love I must get round to it
I ain't ready
Crazy little thing called love

This thing (this thing)
Called love (called love)
It cries (like a baby)
In a cradle all night
It swings (woo woo)
It jives (woo woo)
It shakes all over like a jelly fish
I kinda like it
Crazy little thing called love

There goes my baby
She knows how to rock 'n' roll
She drives me crazy
She gives me hot and cold fever
Then she leaves me in a cool cool sweat

I gotta be cool, relax, get hip
And get on my track's
Take a back seat, hitch-hike
And take a long ride on my motorbike
Until I'm ready
Crazy little thing called love

I gotta be cool, relax, get hip
And get on my track's
Take a back seat (ah hum), hitch-hike (ah hum)
And take a long ride on my motorbike
Until I'm ready (ready Freddie)
Crazy little thing called love

This thing called love I just can't handle it
This thing called love I must get round to it
I ain't ready
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love yeah yeah
Crazy little thing called love yeah yeah
Crazy little thing called love yeah yeah
Crazy little thing called love yeah yeah
Crazy little thing called love yeah yeah
Crazy little thing called love yeah yeah
Crazy little thing called love yeah yeah
Crazy little thing called love yeah yeah
Crazy little thing called love yeah yeah&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Can anybody find me somebody to love
Ooh, each morning I get up I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet
(Take a look at yourself) Take a look in the mirror and cry (and cry)
Lord what you're doing to me (yeah yeah)
I have spent all my years in believing you
But I just can't get no relief, Lord!
Somebody (somebody) ooh somebody (somebody)
Can anybody find me somebody to love ?

Yeah
I work hard (he works hard) every day of my life
I work till I ache in my bones
At the end (at the end of the day)
I take home my hard earned pay all on my own
I get down (down) on my knees (knees)
And I start to pray
Till the tears run down from my eyes
Lord somebody (somebody), ooh somebody
(Please) Can anybody find me somebody to love ?

(He works hard)
Everyday (everyday) - I try and I try and I try
But everybody wants to put me down
They say I'm going crazy
They say I got a lot of water in my brain
Ah, got no common sense
I got nobody left to believe in
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Oh Lord
Ooh somebody - ooh somebody
Can anybody find me somebody to love ?
(Can anybody find me someone to love)

Got no feel, I got no rhythm
I just keep losing my beat (You just keep losing and losing)
I'm OK, I'm alright (he's alright - he's alright)
I ain't gonna face no defeat (yeah yeah)
I just gotta get out of this prison cell
One day (someday) I'm gonna be free, Lord!

Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love love love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love somebody somebody somebody somebody
Somebody find me
Somebody find me somebody to love
Can anybody find me somebody to love ?

(Find me somebody to love)
Ooh
(Find me somebody to love)
Find me somebody, somebody (find me somebody to love) somebody, somebody to love
(Find me somebody to love)
Find me, find me, find me, find me, find me
Ooh - somebody to love
(Find me somebody to love)
Ooh
(Find me somebody to love)
Find me, find me, find me somebody to love
(Find me somebody to love)
Anybody, anywhere, anybody find me somebody to love love love!
Wooo somebody find me, find me love&lt;/lyrics&gt;

A baby I was when you took my hand
And the light of the night burned bright
The people all stared didn't understand
But you knew my name on sight

Ooh whatever came of you and me
America's new bride to be
Ooh, don't worry babe I'm safe and sound

Down in the dungeon just peaches 'n' me

Don't I love her so
Yes you made me live again, yeah

Yeah, ooh, a thin moon me in a smoke-screen sky
Where the beams of your love light chase
Don't move, don't speak, don't feel no pain
With the rain running down my face

Your matches still light up the sky
And many a tear lives on in my eye

Down in the city just Hoople 'n' me

Don't I love him so
Ooh, don't I love him so
Wooh

Whatever comes of you and me
I love to leave my memory with you

Now I'm here (Now I'm here)
Think I'll stay around around around around around around
Down in the city justa you 'n' me (Down in the city justa you 'n' me)
Don't I love you so
Go, go, go, little Queenie
Wooh

&lt;lyrics&gt;I can dim the lights and sing you songs full of sad things
We can do the tango just for two
I can serenade and gently play on your heart strings
Be your valentino just for you

Ooh love - ooh loverboy
What're you doin' tonight, hey boy
Set my alarm, turn on my charm
That's because I'm a good old-fashioned lover boy

Ooh let me feel your heartbeat (Grow faster, faster)
Ooh ooh can you feel my love heat
Come on and sit on my hot-seat of love
And tell me how do you feel right after-all
I'd like for you and I to go romancing
Say the word - your wish is my command

Ooh love - ooh loverboy
What're you doin' tonight, hey boy
Write my letter
Feel much better
And use my fancy patter on the telephone

When I'm not with you
I think of you always
(I miss those long hot summer nights)
I miss you
When I'm not with you
Think of me always
Love you - love you

Hey boy where do you get it from
Hey boy where did you go ?
I learned my passion in the good old
Fashioned school of loverboys

Dining at the Ritz we'll meet at nine precisely
One two three four five six seven eight nine o' clock
I will pay the bill, you taste the wine
Driving back in style, in my saloon will do quite nicely
Just take me back to yours that will be fine (Come on and get it)

Ooh love, (There he goes again just like a good old-fashioned lover boy)
Ooh loverboy
What're you doin' tonight, hey boy
Everything's all right
Just hold on tight
That's because I'm a good old-fashioned fashioned lover boy&lt;/lyrics&gt;

Rest your weary head and let your heart decide
It's so easy when you know the rules
It's so easy all you have to do
Is fall in love
Play the game
Everybody play the game of love
Ooh yeah

When you're feeling down and your resistance is low
Light another cigarette and let yourself go
This is your life
Don't play hard to get
It's a free world
All you have to do is fall in love
Play the game - yeah
Everybody play the game of love
Ooh yeah

My game of love has just begun
Love runs from my head down to my toes
My love is pumping through my veins
Play the game
Driving me insane
Come come come come come play the game
Play the game play the game play the game

Play the game
Everybody play the game of love
This is your life - don't play hard to get
It's a free free world
All you have to do is fall in love
Play the game
Yeah play the game of love
Your life - don't play hard to get
It's a free free world
All you have to do is fall in love
Play the game yeah everybody play the game of love&lt;/lyrics&gt;

I descend upon your Earth from the skies
I command your very souls you unbelievers
Bring before me what is mine
The seven seas of Rhye

Can you hear me you peers and privy counselors
I stand before you naked to the eyes
I will destroy any man who dares abuse my trust
I swear that you'll be mine
The seven seas of Rhye

Sister - I live and lie for you
Mister - do and I'll die
You are mine I possess you
I belong to you forever-ever-ever-aah

Storm the master-marathon I'll fly through
By flash and thunder-fire and
I'll survive - I'll survive - I'll survive
I'll survive - I'll survive - I'll survive
Then I'll defy the laws of nature and come out alive
Then I'll get you
Be gone with you - you shod and shady senators
Give out the good, leave out the bad evil cries
I challenge the mighty Titan and his troubadours
And with a smile
I'll take you to the seven seas of Rhye
Oh I do like to be beside the seaside
Oh I do like to be beside the sea
Where the brass band plays - tiddly om pom pom
Oh I do like to be beside the seaside
Oh I do like to be beside the sea&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;No life till leather
We're gonna kick some ass tonight
We got the metal madness
When our fans start screaming it's right, well alright
When we start to rock we never
Want to stop again

Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights

We know our fans are insane
We're gonna blow this place away
With volume higher
Than anything today, the only way
When we start to rock we never
Want to stop again

Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights

With all our screaming
We're gonna rip right through your brain
We got the lethal power
It's causing you sweet pain, oh sweet pain
When we start to rock we never
Want to stop again

Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;By the last breath the fourth winds blow
Better raise your ears
The sound of hooves knock at your door
Lock up your wife and children now
It's time to wield the blade
For now you've got some company

The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On leather steeds they ride
They've come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the Four Horsemen ride
Or choose your fate and die

You have been dying since the day you were born
You know it's all been planned
The quartet of deliverance rides
A sinner once, a sinner twice
No need for confessions now
'Cause now you've got the fight of your life

The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On leather steeds they ride
They've come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the Four Horsemen ride
Or choose your fate and die

Time has taken its toll on you
The lines that crack your face
Famine, your body it has torn through
Withered in every place
Pestilence, for what you had to endure
And what you have put others through
Death, deliverance for you for sure
Now there's nothing you can do

So gather 'round young warriors now
And saddle up your steeds
Killing scores with demon swords
Now is the death of doers of wrong
Swing the judgement hammer down
Safely inside armor blood guts and sweat

The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On leather steeds they ride
They've come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the Four Horsemen ride
Or choose your fate and die&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Living and dying, laughing and crying
Once you have seen it you'll never be the same
Life in the fast lane is just how it seems
It's hot and it's heavy and dirty and mean

Motorbreath
It's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
Motorbreath
The sign of living fast
It is going to take your breath away

Don't stop for nothing, it's full speed or nothing
I'm taking down, you know, whatever's in my way
Getting your kicks as you're shooting the line
Sending the shivers up and down my spine

Motorbreath
It's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
Motorbreath
The sign of living fast
It is going to take your breath away

Those people who tell you not to take chances
They are all missing on what life's about
You only live once, so take hold of the chance
Don't end up like others, same song and dance

Motorbreath
It's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
Motorbreath
The sign of living fast
It is going to take your breath away&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Down in the depths of my fiery home
The summons bell will chime
Tempting you and all the earth
To join our sinful kind
There's a job to be done and I'm the one
You people make me do it
Now it's time for your fate and I won't hesitate
To pull you down into this pit

So come on
Jump in the fire
So come on
Jump in the fire

With hell in my eyes and with death in my veins
The end is closing in
Feeding on the minds of man
And from their souls within
My disciples all shout to search you out
And they always shall obey
Follow me now, my child, not the meek or the mild
But do just as I say

So come on
Jump in the fire
So come on
Jump in the fire

Jump by your will or be taken by force
I'll get you either way
Trying to keep the hellfire lit
I'm stalking you as prey
Living your life as me, I am you, you see
There is part of me in everyone
So reach down, grab my hand, walk with me through the land
Come home where you belong

So come on
Jump in the fire
So come on
Jump in the fire&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Late at night, all systems go, you've come to see the show
We do our best, you're the rest, you make it real, you know

There is a feeling deep inside that drives you fucking mad
A feeling of a hammerhead, you need it oh so bad

Adrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash

Bang your head against the stage like you never did before
Make it ring, make it bleed, make it really sore

In a frenzied madness with your leather and your spikes
Heads are bobbing all around, it's hot as hell tonight

Adrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash

Here onstage the Marshall noise is piercing through your ears
It kicks your ass, kicks your face, exploding feeling nears

Now's the time to let it rip, to let it fucking loose
We're gathered here to be with you 'cause this is what we choose

Adrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash

The show is through, the metal's gone, it's time to hit the road
Another town, another gig, again we will explode

Hotel rooms and motorways, life out here is raw
But we'll never stop, we'll never quit, 'cause we're Metallica

Adrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Sound is ripping through your ears
The deafening sound of metal nears
Your body's waiting for his whips
The taste of leather on your lips

Hear the cry of war
Louder than before
With his sword in hand
To control the land
Crushing metal strikes
On this frightening night
Fall onto your knees
For the Phantom Lord

Victims falling under chains
You hear them crying dying pains
Fist of terror's breaking through
Now there's nothing you can do

Hear the cry of war
Louder than before
With his sword in hand
To control the land
Crushing metal strikes
On this frightening night
Fall onto your knees
For the Phantom Lord

The leather armies have prevailed
The Phantom Lord has never failed
Smoke is lifting from the ground
The rising volume metal sound

Hear the cry of war
Louder than before
With his sword in hand
To control the land
Crushing metal strikes
On this frightening night
Fall onto your knees
For the Phantom Lord

Fall to your knees
And bow to the Phantom Lord&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;No mercy for what we're doing
No thought to even what we have done
We don't need to feel the sorrow
No remorse for the helpless one

War without end

No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath

Blood feeds the war machine
As it eats a way across the land
We don't need to feel the sorrow
No remorse is the one command

War without end

No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath

Only the strong survive
No will to save the weaker race
We are ready to kill all comers
Like a loaded gun right at your face

War without end

No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath

Attack

Bullets are flying
People are dying
With madness surrounding,
all hell's breaking loose
Soldiers are hounding
Bodies are mounting
Cannons are shouting to take their abuse

With war machines going
Blood starts to flowing
No mercy given to anyone here
The furious fighting
Swords are like lighting
It all becomes frightening,
you know death is near

No remorse&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;We're scanning the scene in the city tonight
We're looking for you to start up a fight
There's an evil feeling in our brains
But it's nothing new, you know it drives us insane

Running, on our way
Hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths
Running, on our way
Hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths

Searching
Seek and destroy
Searching
Seek and destroy
Searching
Seek and destroy
Searching
Seek and destroy

There is no escape and that's for sure
This is the end, we won't take any more
Say goodbye to the world you live in
You have always been taking but now you're giving

Running, on our way
Hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths
Running, on our way
Hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths
Searching
Seek and destroy
Searching
Seek and destroy
Searching
Seek and destroy
Searching
Seek and destroy

Our brains are on fire with the feeling to kill
And it won't go away until our dreams are fulfilled
There is only one thing on our minds
Don't try running away, 'cause you're the one we will find

Running, on our way
Hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths
Running, on our way
Hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths
Searching
Seek and destroy
Searching
Seek and destroy
Searching
Seek and destroy
Searching
Seek and destroy&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Thunder and lightning, the gods take revenge
Senseless destruction
Victims of fury are cowardly now
Running for safety
Stabbing the harlot to pay for her sins
Leaving the virgin
Suicide running as if it were free
Ripping and tearing

Oh, through the mist and the madness
We're trying to get the message to you
Metal militia
Metal militia
Metal militia

Chained and shadowed to be left behind
Nine and one thousand
Metal militia, for your sacrifice
Ironclad soldiers
Join or be conquered, the law of the land
What will befall you?
The metalization of your inner soul
Twisting and turning

Oh, through the mist and the madness
We're trying to get the message to you
Metal militia
Metal militia
Metal militia

We are as one, yes, we all are the same
Fighting for one cause
Leather and metal are our uniforms
Protecting what we are
Joining together to take on the world
With our heavy metal
Spreading the message to everyone here
Come let yourself go

Oh, through the mist and the madness
We're trying to get the message to you
Metal militia
Metal militia
Metal militia&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Blackened is the end
Winter it will send
Throwing all you see
Into obscurity

Death of Mother Earth
Never a rebirth
Evolution's end
Never will it mend

Never

Fire
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Blackened is the end
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Color our world blackened

Blistering of earth
Terminate its worth
Deadly nicotine
Kills what might've been

Callous, frigid chill
Nothing left to kill
Never seen before
Breathing nevermore

Never

Fire
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Blackened is the end
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Color our world blackened

Blackened

Opposition, contradiction, premonition, compromise
Agitation, violation, mutilation, planet dies
Darkest color
Blistered earth
True death of life

Termination, expiration, cancellation, human race
Expectation, liberation, population laid to waste
See our mother
Put to death
See our mother die

Smoldering decay
Take her breath away
Millions of our years
In minutes disappears

Darkening in vain
Decadence remains
All is said and done
Never is the sun

Never

Fire
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Blackened is the end
To begin whipping dance of the dead

Fire
Is the outcome of hypocrisy
Darkest potency
In the exit of humanity
Color our world blackened

Blackened&lt;/lyrics&gt;

Power wolves beset your door
Hear them stalking
Soon you'll please their appetite
They devour
Hammer of justice crushes you
Overpower

The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say
I can't believe, I can't believe the price you pay
Nothing can save you
Justice is lost
Justice is raped
Justice is gone
Pulling your strings
Justice is done
Seeking no truth
Winning is all
Find it so grim, so true, so real

Apathy their stepping stone
So unfeeling
Hidden deep animosity
So deceiving
Through your eyes their light burns
Hoping to find
Inquisition sinking you
With prying minds

The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say
I can't believe, I can't believe the price you pay
Nothing can save you
Justice is lost
Justice is raped
Justice is gone
Pulling your strings
Justice is done
Seeking no truth
Winning is all
Find it so grim, so true, so real

Lady Justice has been raped
Truth assassin
Rolls of red tape seal your lips
Now you're done in
Their money tips her scales again
Make your deal
Just what is truth, I cannot tell
Cannot feel

The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say
I can't believe, I can't believe the price we pay
Nothing can save us
Justice is lost
Justice is raped
Justice is gone
Pulling your strings
Justice is done
Seeking no truth
Winning is all
Find it so grim, so true, so real

Seeking no truth
Winning is all
Find it so grim, so true, so real&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Do you see what I see?
Truth is an offense
Your silence for your confidence

Do you hear what I hear?
Doors are slamming shut
Limit your imagination, keep you where they must

Do you feel what I feel?
Bittering distress
Who decides what you express?

Do you take what I take?
Endurance is the word
Moving back instead of forward seems to me absurd

Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I say

Independence limited
Freedom of choice is made for you, my friend
Freedom of speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception

Do you fear what I fear?
Living properly
Truths to you are lies to me

Do you choose what I choose?
More alternatives
Energy derives from both the plus and negative

Do you need what I need?
Boundaries overthrown
Look inside, to each his own

Do you trust what I trust?
Me, myself, and I
Penetrate the smoke screen, I see through the selfish lie

Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I say

Independence limited
Freedom of choice is made for you, my friend
Freedom of speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception

Do you know what I know?
Your money and your wealth
Your silence just to hear yourself

Do you want what I want?
Desire not a thing
I hunger after independence, lengthen freedom's ring

Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I say

Independence limited
Freedom of choice is made for you, my friend
Freedom of speech is words that they will bend
Freedom no longer frees you

Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I say&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or dream
Deep down inside I feel to scream
This terrible silence stops me

Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there is not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please, God, wake me

Back in the womb it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live

Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please, God, wake me

Now the world is gone, I'm just one
Oh God, help me
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please, God, help me

Darkness imprisoning me
All that I see
Absolute horror
I cannot live
I cannot die
Trapped in myself
Body my holding cell

Landmine has taken my sight
Taken my speech
Taken my hearing
Taken my arms
Taken my legs
Taken my soul
Left me with life in hell&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Suspicion is your name
Your honesty to blame
Put dignity to shame
Dishonor
Witch-hunt modern day
Determining decay
The blatant disarray
Disfigure
The public eye's disgrace
Defying common place
Unending paper chase
Unending

Deafening
Painstaking
Reckoning
This vertigo it doth bring

Shortest straw
Challenge liberty
Downed by law
Live in infamy
Rub you raw
Witch-hunt riding through
Shortest straw
The shortest straw has been pulled for you

Pulled for you
Shortest straw
Pulled for you
Shortest straw
Pulled for you
Shortest straw
The shortest straw has been pulled for you

The accusations fly
Discrimination, why?
Your inner self to die
Intruding
Doubt sunk itself in you
Its teeth and talons through
You're living Catch 2-2
Deluding
A mass hysteria
A megalomania
Reveal dementia
Reveal

Secretly
Silently
Certainly
In vertigo you will be

Shortest straw
Challenge liberty
Downed by law
Live in infamy
Rub you raw
Witch-hunt riding through
Shortest straw
This shortest straw has been pulled for you

Pulled for you
Shortest straw
Pulled for you
Shortest straw
Pulled for you
Shortest straw
Shortest straw has been pulled for you

Shortest straw
Pulled for you
Shortest straw
Pulled for you
Shortest straw
Pulled for you
Shortest straw
Shortest straw has been pulled for you

Behind you, hands are tied
Your being, ostracized
Your hell is multiplied
Upending
The fallout has begun
Oppressive damage done
Your many turned to none
To nothing
You're reaching your nadir
Your will has disappeared
The lie is crystal clear
Defending

Channels red
One word said
Blacklisted
With vertigo make you dead

Shortest straw
Challenge liberty
Downed by law
Live in infamy
Rub you raw
Witch-hunt riding through
Shortest straw
The shortest straw has been pulled for you
Pulled for you&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;My life suffocates
Planting seeds of hate
I've loved, turned to hate
Trapped far beyond my fate

I give, you take
This life that I forsake
Been cheated of my youth
You turned this lie to truth

Anger, misery
You'll suffer unto me

Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad
Harvester of sorrow

Pure black, looking clear
My work is done soon here
Try getting back to me
Get back which used to be

Drink up
Shoot in
Let the beatings begin
Distributor of pain
Your loss becomes my gain

Anger
Misery
You'll suffer unto me

Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad
Harvester of sorrow

All have said their prayers
Invade their nightmares
To see into my eyes
You'll find where murder lies

Infanticide

Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad
Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad
Harvester of sorrow&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Never hunger
Never prosper
I have fallen prey to failure

Struggle within
Triggered again
Now the candle burns at both ends

Twisting under schizophrenia
Falling deep into dementia

Old habits reappear
Fighting the fear of fear
Growing conspiracy
Everyone's after me
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Hear them calling me

Birth of terror
Death of much more
I'm the slave of fear, my captor

Never warnings
Spreading its wings
As I wait for the horror she brings

Loss of interest, question, wonder
Waves of fear they pull me under

Old habits reappear
Fighting the fear of fear
Growing conspiracy
Everyone's after me
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Hear them calling me

Into ruin
I am sinking
Hostage of this nameless feeling

Hell is set free
Flooded I'll be
Feel the undertow inside me

Height, hell, time, haste, terror, tension
Life, death, want, waste, mass depression

Old habits reappear
Fighting the fear of fear
Growing conspiracy
Myself is after me
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Hear them calling me&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Dear Mother
Dear Father
What is this hell you have put me through?
Believer
Deceiver
Day in, day out, live my life through you
Pushed onto me what's wrong or right
Hidden from this thing that they call &quot;life&quot;

Dear Mother
Dear Father
Every thought I'd think you'd disapprove
Curator
Dictator
Always censoring my every move
Children are seen but are not heard
Tear out everything inspired

Innocence
Torn from me without your shelter
Barred reality
I'm living blindly

Dear Mother
Dear Father
Time has frozen still what's left to be
Hear nothing
Say nothing
Cannot face the fact I think for me
No guarantee, it's life as-is
But damn you for not giving me my chance

Dear Mother
Dear Father
You've clipped my wings before
I learned to fly
Unspoiled
Unspoken
I've outgrown that fucking lullaby
Same thing I've always heard from you,
&quot;Do as I say, not as I do&quot;

Innocence
Torn from me without your shelter
Barred reality
I'm living blindly

I'm in hell without you
Cannot cope without you two
Shocked at the world that I see
Innocent victim, please rescue me

Dear Mother
Dear Father
Hidden in your world you've made for me
I'm seething
I'm bleeding
Ripping wounds in me that never heal
Undying spite I feel for you
Living out this hell you always knew&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;As if the wait was not enough
And one can only take so much
You've broken to pieces
Seems hopeless now but at least you know
The tables can turn around and time will repair you

And the rain comes and goes
And all is forgiven
Can we learn to let go
So all is forgiven

You're on your knees reaching out
Reaching for someone
To life you up right off the ground
Is anyone out there?

You can't breathe, you're choking
You'll make it through just keep holding on
I know that it won't be long
'Til somebody saves you

And the rain comes and goes
And all is forgiven
Can we learn to let go
So all is forgiven

When the clouds burn away
All is forgiven
Let the night turn to day
So all is forgiven

Don't stop the rain
From pouring down
Let it wash the pain
Where it can't be found

And the rain comes and goes
And all is forgiven
Can we learn to let go
So all is forgiven

When the clouds burn away
All is forgiven
Let the night turn to day
So all is forgiven

All is forgiven

All is forgiven&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Please don't talk about it
Just leave it alone
What you need's too much for me
You can't squeeze blood from a stone
But there you go

I can't win with or without you
I don't know why
I don't know why
I can't win with or without you
Still I try
Still I try

What were you before me
How was I to know
When you take you alway break
And I won't give no more
So there you go

I can't win with or without you
I don't know why
I don't know why
I can't win with or without you
Still I try
Still I try

Maybe I'm wrong
Maybe I'm way out of line
I lie to myself all the time
I should have been gone so long ago
Would anyone else have known

I can't win with or without you
I don't know why
I don't know why
I can't win with or without you
Still I try
Still I

I can't win with or without you
I don't know why
I don't know why
I can't win with or without you
Still I try
Still I try&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Can hold my breath only for a little while until reality starts sinking in
Once again I'm settling for second best
Turn the page and skip to the end to where I swore that I would try
Since the last time I crossed that line in the back of my mind I know

It only hurts when your eyes are open
Lies get tossed and truth is spoken
It only hurts when that door gets opened
Dreams are lost and hearts are broken

Miles away promise from a burning bead, two worlds should never collide
One word would end it if you ever heard
Tear the page out that reminds me when I swore that I'd be strong
Now the next time has come and gone. Well maybe I'm wrong I know

It only hurts when your eyes are open
Lies get tossed and truth is spoken
It only hurts when that door gets opened
Dreams are lost and hearts are broken

I know what you're feeling
It's hard to believe in someone, someone who's not there
I know that you're waiting cause love is worth saving
But only for so long, so long, so long

I swore that I would try
Since the last time, the last time

It only hurts when your eyes are open
Lies get tossed and truth is spoken
It only hurts when that door gets opened
Dreams are lost and hearts are broken

It only hurts when your eyes are open
Lies get tossed and truth is spoken
It only hurts when that door gets opened
Dreams are lost and hearts are broken&lt;/lyrics&gt;

Artists that can't be verified one way or another will be deleted.  This means if it can't be googled, or it's explicitly stated that this is a personally written song lyric it most likely will not survive long on Lyriki.

If it appears a made-up band is releasing non-existant songs and we can't verify or move it to appropriate categories, it'll be gone. --[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 11:51, 3 May 2006 (PDT)

:After trying to find a song on Lyriki, I've finally seen the usefulness of long discographies... however, I still think they clutter up the artist page, so perhaps we could find a compromise, like creating seperate long discography pages or using javascript to make the long discography appear when it's wanted. --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 22:31, 3 May 2006 (PDT)

== Recent Submissions ==

LyrikiBot now automates recent submissions.

== Recent Submissions - Part 2 ==
Two things I'd like to talk about here. First, I think the script that retrieves the amount of 'good content pages' should be changed. I don't know if it's possible or not, but if you can get the number for the &quot;Template:C:Song&quot; page from the [http://www.lyriki.com/index.php?title=Special:Mostlinked Most Linked To] pages, this will allow the stats to be more accurate (instead of using the [http://www.lyriki.com/index.php?title=Special:Statistics Statistics] page as the source).

Also, I think it would be best to limit the recent submissions to about 20 or 30, whenever people do a lot at a time, a lot of pages are put into that recent submissions, making it look long and unnecessary--[[User:268229|268229]] 18:10, 3 February 2006 (PST)&lt;br&gt;
Bump: Another example of why it needs to be changed. The stats page currently says there 6,029 &quot;song&quot; pages, the most linked to page says 6083 pages. Shouldn't the counter actually be accurate? =P Hopefully doing this is possible :) --[[User:268229|268229]] 02:49, 8 April 2006 (PDT)

::Doesn't seem to be doing a whole lot :S --[[User:Sidewinded|Sidewinded]] 19:15, 20 June 2006 (PDT)

::The best way of counting song entries in the wiki is to check how many pages link to the [[:Category:Songs|Songs]] category or the [[Template:C:Song|C:Song]] template. --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 22:38, 20 June 2006 (PDT)

== Featured Artist ==

Maybe a randomly selected artist of the week? With a picture and and selected trivia. Might be useful to a target for people to flesh out and finish. [[User:Bailey|Bailey]] 18:09, 3 February 2006 (PST)

== got an idea for improvment ==

im just writing the John Frusciante artist page and it taks allot of time to write the code any time, its seems pointless to write &quot; ((artist:title|title))&quot;
this site is all about lyrics any way so you should build a script that needs only the name of the album and the songs withen it and the site will set things up it self... it will be way more easy

:Right now the best I've got are [http://it.travisbsd.org/foo/lyriki/ these scripts]. --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 14:46, 13 February 2006 (PST)

:Updated link. --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 09:41, 29 April 2006 (PDT)

:: well thats quite good enough for me :] [[User:Doitch|Doitch]]

:: Could you please make the code for those script available? --[[User:Attendant|Attendant]] 22:31, 2 May 2006 (PDT)

::: Sorry, I misunderstood what those script were for (I thought they were not only capable of formating the text but also could add the pages). Does anybody knows if it's possible to interface with the wiki so (for example) one could create a script which sits on a client machine and add missing pages when it can? (the client part is very much doable with current amaroK facilities). --[[User:Attendant|Attendant]] 23:02, 2 May 2006 (PDT)

:::: Yes it's possible, simply post the information much as the wiki does anyways.  Similar to how LyrikiBot does recent updates. --[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 23:08, 2 May 2006 (PDT)

::::I can make PHP scripts that create pages via [[User:MindlessBot|MindlessBot]], but then I can't release a working script because I'd be giving away it's password.  I think it might also be possible for me to use JavaScript to create pages... --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 04:20, 3 May 2006 (PDT)

::::: Well, I have succeeded at login in by posting the information as suggested but I still couldn't get adding pages to work... It may have something to do with the fact that the edit form uses a different encoding type (multipart/form-data) than the login form (application/x-www-form-urlencoded), though I'm not sure. If anybody can give me ''any'' pointers I'll be more than gratefull.

::::::The edit form should accept ''application/x-www-form-urlencoded''.  Make sure you fetch the '''wpEditToken''' from the edit page, since I *think* this is required to creat a page.  (I know it's required when editing a page.)  Also you may need to make sure that you are not ignoring cookies.  This is important in PHP, but I'm not sure if JavaScript will handle cookies by itself. --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 19:35, 4 May 2006 (PDT)

:::::::You're completely right. I just can't believe I wasted so much time trying to figure out how to output multipart/form-data with ethereal :-\ ... Anyway, thank you very much, you've saved me a lot of time. Now that I have succeeded at creating pages the rest should be pretty straight forward. --[[User:Attendant|Attendant]] 21:04, 4 May 2006 (PDT)

::::: As a side note, I'll explain a little what the script I have in mind is supposed to do, maybe someone can contribute to the idea. Basically, the script will react to amaroK's track change notification checking if a page for the (now playing) song exists in Lyriki. If it doesn't (else there's nothing to do), it will fetch the lyrics from amaroK and (if found) create a Lyriki page for it. Things such as artist, song title, lyrics and any other information to submit will be verified and corrected as much as they can to ease the pain of future editors. Also, pages will be added in a special category so that they can be easily identified. Obviously, this script is not meant to be used side by side with the current amaroK Lyriki script (since that wouldn't make any sense) but with any of the other ones. --[[User:Attendant|Attendant]] 21:56, 3 May 2006 (PDT)

::::: What if there was a bot that monitored Recent changes for orphaned song pages (pages for which no artist page exists) and automatically created them.  Then through the use of What links here it could add any other orphaned songs by that artist to the page and begin a discography.  Alternately if monitoring the recent schanges page is too technical, it could be a php page that was pinged so that a user could create a song page and send the artist name as a query to the script which would then create an artist page.[[User:Olleicua|Olleicua]] 19:00, 26 July 2006 (PDT)

== Verification ==

I'd like to see somewhere in the template for verification.  That is, if I listen to a song and watch the lyrics, and they are correct (as far as I can tell), I can add a note saying, &quot;I verify, on such-and-such a date.&quot;  Then, as songs accumulate verifications, you could be more and more sure that they lyrics were correct, versus a song that someone might have entered and not been very careful about.  What do you all think? -- [[User:Risser|Risser]]

:I've thought about this before, the problem is that people may just pop on and say that they verify the lyrics of a song, but really they have no idea whether they are correct or not.  Perhaps we could have a template for verification that says that the user has checked the lyrics against the lyrics on the CDs lyrics booklet or from the artist's website.  On the other hand, if you think that the lyrics of a song are incorrect, you can always mark it for '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{accuracy}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' verification. --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 14:35, 16 February 2006 (PST)

:: Yeah, I thought about that, but at some point, this is all about volunteers anyway. Back when AudioScrobbler was still voting on Mods, you had a few dorks who just &quot;NO&quot; voted everything, which was a royal pain in the arse.  But, this is a Wiki, and we have to trust that most people are here for the good of it.  Anyway, I think if you tag it with a sig, we'd soon see who was worth listening to and who was just tagging for giggles.  I also agree that it should have a note about what it was verified against (artist site, cd book, by ear, etc.). --[[User:Risser|risser]] 05:52, 17 February 2006 (PST)

:Also, I think that if we have verification messages, they should go on the talk pages, as to not clutter up the actual song page. --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 15:25, 16 February 2006 (PST)

:: This makes sense.  I may just start doing that.  I'll start with [[The Faint:Desperate Guys|Desperate Guys]] by [[The Faint]].  See how it looks and let me know what you think.  Also, I think it's important that we stress that the lyrics need to reflect how the song sounds, not what it says in the book/site, because these are often abbreviated and occasionally wrong. --[[User:Risser|risser]] 05:52, 17 February 2006 (PST)

:: I've decided to tag any new page or update I make in the Talk page.  For example, [http://lyriki.com/index.php?title=Talk:%22Weird_Al%22_Yankovic:Germs here's] one I did where I got the lyrics from a site, then verified them by ear.  I think putting the source is helpful. --[[User:Risser|risser]] 07:26, 17 February 2006 (PST)

::: It's been on my mind for a while, but while browsing through the recent changes page, it would be great if you could put in '''Verification''' in the Summary form. Otherwise it can be difficult to distinguish between a real talk page (where a problem may need to be discussed) and a talk page with just a verification note.--[[User:268229|268229]] 22:51, 8 March 2006 (PST)

:::: I will try that. I only recently just learned what the summary field was for.  :)  --[[User:Risser|risser]] 04:53, 9 March 2006 (PST)

== Search plugin for Firefox ==

Yesterday I made a small Lyriki search plugin for Firefox. It's the first one I've made and I would appreciate if someone who knows this stuff would rewrite it. But it works to me, so I thought I could tell you about it. Do you think there is any use for it?

Download it [http://mycroft.mozdev.org/download.html?name=lyriki&amp;submitform=Search here]. --Lime 03:10, 17 February 2006 (PST)

::I'd recommend putting this on the front page --[[User:Sidewinded|Sidewinded]] 15:17, 16 June 2006 (PDT)

== Year Category ==

How difficult is it to set up a new category?  It might be interesting to have a year category, divided maybe by decades... --[[User:Risser|risser]] 07:02, 20 February 2006 (PST)

:It's fairly easy, but I'm not sure if we want year categories.  If we did, we would probably only categorize albums and not songs.  (Genre categories have also been suggested.) --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 15:45, 20 February 2006 (PST)
:: This'd also work for artists, but it'd have to be manually set in contrast to the albums just being able to done automatically because the year's in the page name.--[[User:Sidewinded|Sidewinded]] 19:40, 17 June 2006 (PDT)

== A few questions ==

I have a few questions.  First off, is this the place to ask questions?  If not, where?  Second, the main page says not to copy from CD booklets and I assume this means that we also cannot copy lyrics from other lyrics sites or band pages.  Is that right and if so, is typing out the lyrics ourselves legally any different from copying them from another site?  I'm not a lawyer but I would think that the lyrics themselves are copyrighted, rather than the particular typed out versions, so this requirement doesn't do anything for the site legally and just creates unneeded work.  I think other sites justify having copyrighted lyrics by appealing to &quot;fair use&quot; rather than claiming that they typed it out themselves.  Third, I noticed some bands have an &quot;Artist Info&quot; with a link to the band website and only the band website, is that it or can we add descriptions or links to other pages (e.g., their wikipedia page)? [[User:Chiok|Chiok]] 21:24, 24 February 2006 (PST)

: Fair use is a large part of Lyriki's legal beliefs.  Because we're not making any profit via advertisements with Lyriki.  We actually have a larger claim to 'fair use' then some competing websites.  The legal difference from copying other sites and books is not much, but, it's more to avoid possible legal hassle.  If this site is built on a community of users passionate about music so much that they're willing to listen to the songs to post the lyrics instead of simply scraping other sites.  As well with the non-profit nature of lyriki, it seems awful assinine to bring legal action.  It's minute, and more of a request then an absolute rule.  To be perfectly honest, there's very little way to tell on some songs whether you've copied it or written it from listening.  I'm not sure if that answers your questions entirely or not.  --[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 10:20, 25 February 2006 (PST)

:: Here's how I look at it.  I don't post anything I haven't listened and verified first.  A lot of times, I'll use the lyrics from another site as a base, because this is faster than typing in every word by hand.  But, I have yet to find one that was close to correct and didn't need at least some major revisioning.  As for booklets, again, booklets often reflect what the artist intended, not what they ended up singing necessarily.  Also, my understanding is, sometimes, like on GH comps, they employ someone to sit and type out the words, just like we are, and that dude probably has no better understanding than we do.  So, verify before you post, if you can.  That's my take on it.  --[[User:Risser|risser]] 13:25, 26 February 2006 (PST)

:: I've been posting lyrics in much the same way.  A bunch of the lyrics I've submitted are in the emo/screamo genre, and often times hard to make out without consulting an outside source (whether it be a CD/lyric book, or another lyric site).  I don't see a problem with transcribing lyrics in this way.  I've also went ahead, and remove a lot of the short-hand crap, like [2x] or [Verse] and [Chorus] notes, to make the lyrics linear and easy to follow.  It just makes it a lot easier to copy the lyrics, and then transcribe the rest and write it down. --[[User:Ahoier|ahoier]] 05:19, 11 June 2006 (PDT)

I also have another question, what about Album Artists? Sometimes a compilation might have a special name for the collective group of artists, something like Various Artists, and each track might have different Artists. How are these classified, and will this database account for such VA albums? An example like Ministry of Sound, or Smash-Ups, would these Album Artists simply be put between parenthesis?  --[[User:201.154.57.160|201.154.57.160]] 11:47, 2 March 2006 (PST)

:I think we've decided on using (Various Artists) where it does apply.  The actual songs are linked as by the artists that perform the song.  If I'm understanding correctly.  The album would be something like (Various Artists):Ministry of Sound (Year).  Hope that helps. --[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 15:58, 2 March 2006 (PST)

== Artist name format changed, how to change it back? ==

I added Anti-Flag a while ago (before I created my username).  Today I came in to add some more lyrics and update my formatting to the standard, and found that the band name has changed to Anti-flag (lower case F).  This has broken some of the links from the song pages.  How can I change it back? --[[User:Meiers3f|Meiers3f]] 17:32, 11 March 2006 (PST)

:I moved [[Anti-flag]] to [[Anti-Flag]].  I assume that's what you wanted? --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 19:30, 11 March 2006 (PST)

::In the future, if Anti-flag were what you actually wanted, you should do two things.  First, create a #REDIRECT &lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;Anti-flag]] on the Anti-Flag page.  Then, anyone who visits the latter will be redirected to the former.  Then you can, from the Anti-Flag page, select &quot;What Links Here&quot; on the toolbox on the left, and it will show you all the pages that link to that page, so you can update them if you wish. --[[User:Risser|risser]] 19:15, 12 March 2006 (PST)

Thank you!  Any idea why the F in Anti-Flag changed to lower case since the last time I was on?  I would rather the Anti-flag page did not exist, and everything worked through the Anti-Flag page.  --[[User:Meiers3f|Meiers3f]] 7:18, 12 March 2006 (PST)

== Samples ==

I know this is Lyriki, and not Sampliki, but I've always wanted a place to store Sample references; that is when one song samples or is sampled by another.  Would anyone else be interested in seeing this added to the song data page?  We could do headings like Lyrics, Sampled By, Samples, Quotes and what not.  I know we've talked about having pages for Instrumentals, just for that reason.  And we're also slowly turning this into a Discography database as well...  Just wondering what you all think. 

I posted an example on [[Will Smith:Wild Wild West]] and [[The Sugarhill Gang:Rapper's Delight]]. --[[User:Risser|risser]] 18:32, 22 March 2006 (PST)

: I actually completely missed this post, but, this is a great idea for those that want to put the effort in.  I myself am horrible with tracking down that kind of information, but I see no reason for it not to be included.  --[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 21:28, 29 April 2006 (PDT)

== Missing song name? ==

What if we know the lyrics to a song, but don't know the name?

:You can probably Google the song lyrics to find the song name.  --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 20:20, 26 March 2006 (PST)

::Enter the first (or most unique) line of the lyrics into google using quotes &quot;&quot;, it'll give you the exact result of the lyrics on lots of other websites, then just read the artist name and song title from one of those sites ;)--[[User:268229|268229]] 23:14, 26 March 2006 (PST)

:::It would be a cool thing to do it here though too, ie. search that would identify an actual string in the article text rather than at the moment when it just picks out words, you know [[User:Ufundo|Ufundo]] 03:20, 24 April 2006 (PDT)

== Categories ==

This may have already been discussed but I can't find where if it has. It's about the categories. Is there a way that we could change it so the Album comes first in the Album category and ditto for the Song category. It gets confusing to me, especially in the larger categories looking for a particular Song or Album and having to read through the Artists names. For example, try going to the [http://www.lyriki.com/index.php?title=Category:Songs:N Songs:N] category and looking for the Beatles song &quot;The Night Before&quot;.  If &quot;Night&quot; was the first word on the line instead of the middle it would be much easier to find. - [[User:Troy34|Troy34]] 11:54, 31 March 2006 (PST)

:Sorry, but I don't think that can be done. --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 05:22, 1 April 2006 (PST)
::I'm a programmer, i've never come across anything that can't be done. - [[User:Troy34|Troy34]] 07:49, 1 April 2006 (PST)

:::OK, it probably can be done with a MediaWiki mod of some sort... --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 13:39, 8 April 2006 (PDT)

== Template or not? ==

Hi all.  I'm confused about one little thing: Is there a consensus to use the SSong template at the top of a song page, or the non-template thing which folks have been adding to my recent submissions?

Right now I don't know which style to use, so I've not been putting anything. -- [[User:Mark|Mark]] 05:30, 7 April 2006 (PDT)
:Welcome to Lyriki. It's best to use a [http://www.lyriki.com/index.php?title=Help:Adding_New_Songs&amp;oldid=6984 template] as it will make the pages easier to organise and categorise. I suggest you choose one of the two templates that you think would suit best and use that. If you choose the SSong template, I'd recommend for you to edit the pages that I've re-formated for you already (so the lyrics pages don't lose their consistancy).--[[User:268229|268229]] 19:59, 7 April 2006 (PDT)
::So the choice is being left to the contributor?  Shouldn't there be an attempt to find a consensus? -- [[User:Mark|Mark]] 00:45, 20 April 2006 (PDT)

== Extremist Ideas ==

Just some radical thoughts to be critiqued:
# find case-insensitive wiki software (ex. DocuWiki)
# develop (PHP?) tools to interface with adding content to wiki software
# determine page standards
# archive this wiki db and start using the new wiki (and tools)

These are just some thoughts due to the inconsistency of content added to this wiki.

The reason I mention DocuWiki is because:
* pagenames are AFAIK case-insensitive
* when the account management is set up, you can dis-allow certain users from creating pages in certain namespaces&lt;br&gt;(So, for example, all users could be allowed to create [[Help:Contents|Help]] pages and such, but dis-allowed from creating other pages, which would be created by using the tools.  They would still be able to edit all pages, though.)

The major problems are that:
* most people are comfortable with MediaWiki
* DocuWiki lacks some of MediaWiki's functions

Thoughts will be appreciated. --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 15:40, 10 April 2006 (PDT)

: Case-insensitive wiki software is low priority, easier tools probably somewhere in the middle, it'd be great to have some tools that make adding and verifying data a cinch.  Page standards are very high up there.  I think we've got a very good base, it just needs to be cemented until we find need to make additions.  Archiving the wiki db actually should be done fairly regularly, so should we ever choose to move to another wiki system, that's taken care of.  Now, all that being said.   I'm not sure how much switching would improve things overall?  The biggest thing showing up right now is just that Lyriki is very high maintainence, and without the efforts of you and 268829(?) it'd be a chaotic mess.  You guys definately get a cookie :P.  Which, hopefully, once we get some tools developed for certain things it'll be much easier to maintain and some of the current problems won't be as noticeable.  --[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 07:22, 11 April 2006 (PDT)

:: Case insensitive article titles shouldnt be a real priority because there should only be one proper capitilization for every song, album etc. - the one that the artist gives to it [[User:Ufundo|Ufundo]] 03:23, 24 April 2006 (PDT)

I believe we need to promote this site more. There are still too few songs in the database. For this reason I have created a new page to discuss this and have some suggestions. [[Promotion]]. Lets see what we can think of. --[[User:Db0|Db0]] 13:33, 23 April 2006 (PDT)

== Song Meanings ==

This is actually something I posted elsewhere in the early early days of lyriki, more when I was advertising for lyriki there was a post on another wiki (wikicities I think) asking if there was a wiki for song meanings and I suggested that lyriki could fit that role, this could be another possible use for the talk pages on songs, or there could be a namespace made.  Input welcome.  --[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 21:29, 29 April 2006 (PDT)

: I think this is a good idea and could go on the discussion page for each song. A problem that plagues sites like songmeanings.net is people who just post comments like &quot;OMG11!!! I love this band and tHiS is my fAvOuRiTe song from ThIs album!&quot; (Yes, this is how some of them talk). It seems out of the 20 people who post comments about the song, only 3 are on-topic. --[[User:Horvath|Horvath]] 22:13, 3 August 2006 (PDT)

== Foreign Languages and Soundtracks ==

As an example, how would I go about entering the lyrics for an anime series?    AFAIK, there’s no procedure for entering soundtracks let alone multiple soundtracks under a single subject.  Also, entering lyrics for a Japanese song would require 3 sections: one for the native script, one for the Romanized script, and one for the translation. [[User:IngisKahn|IngisKahn]] 07:53, 2 May 2006 (PDT)

:They'd follow the same rules for everything else.  A soundtrack would usually fall under various artists.  Perhaps if it's needed an (OST) tag can be applied, something to discuss anyways.  As for three entries per song, that's really a bit much.  I think I'd prefer romanized versions of the natural language as the default, but, the biggest problem with that is differing systems of romanization.  The reason for not really wanting to support native script is two-fold, it not working as the title, and it would require an extra download to support.  The translation would be optional, although some foreign language songs already do have the language then the translation.  If there's overwhelming demand for it then it can always be added later. --[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 10:09, 2 May 2006 (PDT)

== Database dumps ==

I like the idea of a lyrics wiki, but I'm afraid that one day it will go offline. So it seems like a good idea to make a database dump each month and make it available for download (just as wikipedia does (and that's a site that will probably stay up until the end of time)) so that someone else could continue the site. This will also save a lot of bandwidth because users won't use a spider if they need the whole content of the site

[[User:Garo|Garo]] 04:55, 24 May 2006 (PDT)

:This is not a bad idea, and something that I will look into.  It shouldn't be particularly hard to set up.  Thank you for the suggestion!  --[[User:Evelyn|Evelyn]] 13:52, 26 May 2006 (PDT)

: *BUMP* --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 16:45, 21 August 2006 (PDT)

::So, I'm looking into this idea.  I don't have a particular problem with it, but I'll have to monitor things to be sure that it doesn't get out of hand: the database is 150mb right now, and if I have a lot of people pulling down copies of it on a regular basis then it will start to eat up a lot of bandwidth.  However, if I do a dump at the end of every month it shouldn't be a major problem.  I'll work on setting this up and post here when it's good to go. --[[User:Evelyn|Evelyn]] 10:43, 22 August 2006 (PDT)

:: I think if one really wants to put one on there they should be able to, Makes the artist page a little more appealing. --[[User:Sidewinded|Sidewinded]] 17:16, 23 June 2006 (PDT)
::: I have no problem with this myself.  I do believe it'd be a bit of effort to update most of the pages, but, anyone willing to make the effort should feel free too. --[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 18:18, 30 September 2006 (PDT)

== A big community ==

I've been looking in the internet, for a site like yours : I've found that http://www.lyricwiki.org does the same job as you with the same purpose. They are 500 users your are 250 users, why don't you merge your databases ? It's easy : both are using MediaWiki. 

It's not that I think that your or they website is wrong, only that it would be a faster growing web site. 

Bye see you soon.

:We've kind'a come to the decision that Lyriki ignore LyricWiki and LyricWiki ignores Lyriki...  LyricWiki got on the front page of Digg, Lyriki didn't... so it's mainly a matter of personal preference.  Also most of the content on LyricWiki was harvested and bot submitted, but most of the content here is human-submitted (and that which is bot-submitted is automatically marked for review).  --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 20:14, 10 June 2006 (PDT)

::Lyriki also does not agree with the tactics and commercialism behind lyricwiki.org. --[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 14:30, 17 June 2006 (PDT)

:Personally I don't like their style that most of their pages seem to have accuired, and while I agree a merge would help each site, I don't think it'd work out. --[[User:Sidewinded|Sidewinded]] 19:34, 17 June 2006 (PDT)

::A merge would end up with us having a lot of malformed pages, and would require ceding control of the site to a corporate entity and also mean including advertising on the site.  These terms are very clearly unacceptable. --[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 17:35, 30 September 2006 (PDT)

:Unfortunately when you want to start a lyrics site, you need a big database or you won't be the first visit when a user is looking for song lyrics. This may mean initial bot submissions. Because LyricWiki has a large database now, they can convince users (such as myself) to use it primarily and update and include song lyrics where required. -- oticon6

::That would be under the assumption that we're looking for users that want a free easy ride.  If you're happier there, please stay there.  Lyriki is doing just fine despite having half the number of users and less then 10% the number of pages.  It's continuing to grow without needing the digg effect or rapid viral advertisement.  It's also continuing to be the choice of many many users due to the higher quality of the pages that -are- here. --[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 05:17, 30 October 2006 (PST)

== lenght, artist, and wikipedia ==

only some questions...&lt;br&gt;
1- wouldn't it be a good idea to put the lenght of each song in the album pages? maybe in the lyrics page too...&lt;br&gt;
2- why put &lt;nowiki&gt;[[links]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; in the member list of the artist pages? i mean, is there a &quot;person page&quot;?&lt;br&gt;
3- is it ok to copy biographical information from wikipedia to put in the artist pages?&lt;br&gt;
--[[User:Pedro Fonini|Pedro Fonini]] 05:21, 22 June 2006 (PDT)
:the length of each song can be added to the album page, there is a note stating that &lt;small&gt;(m:ss)&lt;/small&gt; is the proper formatting for song lengths.  As far as point 2, I've seen the members done both ways, some use wiki links, others don't.  I don't know what the general concensus is, but if a band member is not his/her own band; then wiki links aren't that necessary.  For example when I created the [[No Doubt]] page, I used inter-wiki links for each member, but they were later modified and only kept for [[Gwen Stefani]] since she has her pop-dance side project.  Since this is merely a lyrics site/project, I don't know how necessary the members area is really though...And as far as point 3, I would think it's OK.  You can view my contribs and see how I've created my past artist pages, but I just use a small blurb from allmusic, basically stating when and where they formed and what style of music they are.  Nothing extravagant, since there are other sites geared towards biographies and what not...and well, usually if someone is looking up lyrics for an artist, they probably already know the biographic information, or just don't care either way (IMO ofcourse :P) --[[User:Ahoier|ahoier]] 08:13, 22 June 2006 (PDT)
::1. The track length is an option, some people use it, others don't. If you can get the length, feel free to add it.
::2. I only put links to members of a band if they have got their own albums/songs. I think people have just been adding it to every member since without a care :(
::3. Depends how much you copy, I see people doing a small paragraph and then linking to the source for more information. As long it's done with respect to copyrights, it should be fine.
::--[[User:268229|268229]] 17:45, 22 June 2006 (PDT)
And what about put a field in {{[[Template:Song|Song]]}} and {{[[Template:SSong|SSong]]}} to lenght? --[[User:Pedro Fonini|Pedro Fonini]] 08:40, 27 June 2006 (PDT)
:I'm all for track times on the album pages, as it adds a little more information to the page.  But I don't think it's too necessary for track times on the Song pages...as it is, the track times are going to vary from person to person; due to the digital age of music and how some people &quot;split&quot; apart tracks after ripping and such.  And then, what time would be put on the song page, the actual song time from the album cover/sleeve, or the track length displayed in the media player (I've seen albums where the track time on the cover/sleeve is different than the length on the actual CD..).--[[User:Ahoier|ahoier]] 07:27, 28 June 2006 (PDT)
::I think the same time that's shown in the alum page should be shown in the song page... It's not &quot;neccessary&quot;, but as you said, ''it adds a little more information to the page.'' --[[User:Pedro Fonini|Pedro Fonini]] 16:20, 28 June 2006 (PDT)
:::Well, if I add my dog's name I will also be adding &quot;a little more information to the page&quot;... The point is that the track length is (as my dog's name) completely irrelevant to a page that's supposed to have the '''''lyrics''''' to a song. As it has already been stated by Ahoier, the track length can vary a lot even between &quot;same versions&quot; of a song. Now add to that the fact that lyrics pages can be linked by a number of different album pages (albums with different versions of a song, live albums, covers by other artists, etc...) and you'll find that it will only lead to even more unnecessary confussion. --[[User:Attendant|Attendant]] 18:57, 28 June 2006 (PDT)

== FINISHED pages ==

On my page I've been updating (sorta) what albums sections I've completed (albums or whole artists)
It would be nice to see a catagory for finished sections to see what's done and what not, it'd probably have to be done manually. Nothing serious here, just an idea. --[[User:Sidewinded|Sidewinded]] 09:54, 8 July 2006 (PDT)

:::: Nononono, you guys it's like this its basically a criteria:

I've just been putting &quot;complete&quot; or something like that in the edit summary, after I confirm lyrics.  But yea, it's hard to say something is &quot;complete&quot;, since someone later could come along with a better ear (hearing) and pick out new words and such :P  I personally try to stick to the vocals up front, and not worry too much about background vocals/screaming and such, but in time, they could be added. heh --[[User:Ahoier|ahoier]] 09:55, 10 July 2006 (PDT)

== Bug ==

I was taking a look at [[:Category:Lyriki:Incomplete]] pages and noticed (cause of &quot;Xutos &amp; Pontapés&quot;) that pages with &quot;&amp;&quot; in the name doesn't work with [http://www.lyriki.com/wiki/Xutos_%26_Pontap%C3%A9s /wiki/Name], only with [http://www.lyriki.com/?title=Xutos_%26_Pontap%C3%A9s ?title=Name]. Can someone fix it? --[[User:Pedro Fonini|Pedro Fonini]] 15:25, 8 July 2006 (PDT)

:I'll forward this to Evelyn and see if we can find a solution, thanks for the heads up. --[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 19:05, 8 July 2006 (PDT)

::It looks like this is a known issue with the mod_rewrite apache module I was using to make it so that wiki/Name worked: It fails on URLs with an &amp; chararcter in them.  I found a fix, but it doesn't work on apache 2.x (which we're using).  Until I can find something that will work I've had to disable it.

== Auto-generated pages ==

A little embarrassing for me to ask, but, how exactly are the auto-generated lyrics done?  I agree with the way we've gone about it, so that things that aren't verified accurate are clearly labelled so, but, I haven't been able to evaluate how it's done myself.  Very much not wanting to fall in step with competing wiki's where all the lyrics are bot done and people don't care about accuracy. --[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 19:00, 8 July 2006 (PDT)

::That would explain why only a handful of users show up with it ;).  I wonder what the possibility of porting this to work with a player like Winamp or Foobar would be?  --[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 06:44, 11 July 2006 (PDT)

::If it could be ported to any kind of usable form in windows, it'd make me happy &gt;D  IE: If I could just run lyriki.rb Songname and get results. :) --Nanenj but not signed in &gt;D

:::you can already run lyriki.rb in windows, you just need to install ruby (http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=167). now, porting the script to winamp is a completely diferent issue (don't know about foobar). the biggest problem is that winamp plugins are written in c (c++?) which doesn't provide natively regular expressions or an api to communicate through http (which is basically all the script does :\) --[[User:Attendant|Attendant]] 20:11, 13 July 2006 (PDT)

::Hmm, then it might already run as intended... well, partially seems it requires GTK and QT bindings?  (QT does seem a little problematic on Windows.  Haven't gotten to see how troublesome GTK is/might be yet.) --[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 06:15, 14 July 2006 (PDT)

A new issue involving autogenerated pages is coming to my attention.  It seems somehow googleads are making it into some of the autogenerated pages, if this can be fixed, I'd be very grateful.  The ad-code being inserted on lyriki pages is potentially harmful.  --[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 13:54, 30 September 2006 (PDT)

:Can you please point me to one of those pages? --[[User:Attendant|Attendant]] 14:49, 30 September 2006 (PDT)


::As far as I can tell, they've all been edited out already, but, they do show up in the history of the page.  I'll have to bookmark the next one I see.

== Problem ==

The Lyriki seems to have problems with ampersands. For example, the page [[Belle &amp; Sebastian]] links to a non-existant page Belle, making it impossible to recover the data on the page. This also happened with [[The Mamas &amp; The Papas]], so I am confident the problem is the ampersand.

== Chorus' ==

Alrighty, this is a bit of a matter of opinion, but I was wondering if u you guys like having the chorus repeated in full, or rather putting (chorus),(chorus x2), etc.
Personally I don't like having to refer back to the chorus, because on some artists they may change parts of it slightly, and I'm trying to keep the lyrics as close to the song as I hear it.
Tell me what you guys think --[[User:Sidewinded|Sidewinded]] 09:56, 12 July 2006 (PDT)

== Hosted Files ==
Something I've considered, but, would not implement without passing it through the crowd here...  I've thought about trying to make contact with bands and asking permission to host one or more tracks, DRM-Free, etc.  Chances are not many would jump at it.  But, it  might increase Lyriki's popularity, and to the bands that want the exposure, supporting Lyriki and 'free-music' would bring lots of positive exposure me thinks.  If anyone on Lyriki knows bands that would like to become more known, that would be a great place to start.  The downside to this, is some could interpret it as Lyriki being a more commercial entity (which is bad! :P).  There's no money going around in this idea, just asking permission to post MP3 or OGG files of certain tracks, if yes, we do, if no, then we leave it be.

Some might be asking if Lyriki is already legal on the text side, why do we need permission for the OGG or MP3, can't we use the same protections?  Unfortunately, hosting a .ogg or .mp3 has different implications than plain text and in some cases has even been determined to be broadcasting.  This could be another downside, even if we get permission, we may, at a later date, be asked by some  place to pay licensing fees for all the 'broadcasts' we've done of hosted songs.  I'm looking into this as well and this -will- not happen if that's required.  Anyways, after reading all that, the core question is just whether people like the idea of trying to get bands behind Lyriki and have their songs showcased here, or would rather just not bother. --[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 09:52, 20 August 2006 (PDT)

: The idea is interesting but I personally think it’s beyond the scope of lyriki. Usually bands that wish to showcase a track will either offer it as a download on their official website or as a stream. People generally don't come to this website to find/explore new artists, there are plenty of other websites that cater to that service. --[[User:Horvath|Horvath]] 20:00, 20 August 2006 (PDT)

: I agree with [[User:Horvath|Horvath]].  Most of the bands that would give you permission are independant artists that already have their music hosted on sites with the specific purpose of promoting independant artists.  However, as long as Lyriki has bandwidth to spare, there's no reason not to host files if the artist gives permission... it just wouldn't be a major focus.  --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 16:25, 21 August 2006 (PDT)

: Another thought following &quot;''The downside to this, is some could interpret it as Lyriki being a more commercial entity (which is bad! :P).''&quot;
: If other users start to upload songs, someone will have to police them to make sure that they are freely useable on Lyriki (unless you can limit uploading music files to admins only or something).  --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 16:37, 21 August 2006 (PDT)

::It would never be a major focus, just a 'perk'.  Something along the lines of a featured song on the front page promoting an independent artist.  The uploading of songs would not be facilitated by the wiki software, just a link inserted to a location on the host :). --[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 11:04, 23 August 2006 (PDT)

== Genres Genres Genres!! ==

I suggest there should be genre pages, for example: [[Alternative rock]], which would explain the genre and have a list of groups.  I also suggest a genre links to be on the [[Main Page]], so new users can find the groups/lyrics by genre.  [[User:Maya Levy|Maya Levy]] 01:18, 21 September 2006 (PDT)

: The biggest problem is that different people clasify music in different genres: one person's Rock is another's Metal.  This isn't very practical unless there's a standard for genres.  If there's a site that has a genre database, we could refer to that when categorizing, but I don't know of any. --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 14:34, 21 September 2006 (PDT)

:: All Music Guide has this information in their artist pages. Btw, they consider Rock a genre and Heavy Meta a style (or a subgenre). --[[User:Attendant|Attendant]] 15:09, 21 September 2006 (PDT)

::: Heh, shows what I know about genres...  I suppose we could use AMG's genres. --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 19:53, 21 September 2006 (PDT)

:: Is up to the community on this one.  I personally think that there are many bands that release music in a variety of genres despite having one they normally stick too makes it hard to do genre reliably. --[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 00:23, 23 September 2006 (PDT)

::: There is also the fact that bands don't always fall under just one genre. Bands evolve, so maybe instead of tagging the bands/artists themselves, perhaps tagging individual songs? This would take much longer, obviously, but could potentially be a great idea. --[[User:Suspchaos|Suspchaos]] 20:04, 30 September 2006 (PDT)

:::: My stance has changed on this to a formal 'no' vote.  Genre is too opinionated, and it's not something that you can clearly classify.  Classifying songs would take much too long, and it doesn't lend much value to either the discography information or the lyrics themselves.  As with most everything on Lyriki, it's still a community thing, but, all things considered genre doesn't offer much value for the work invested. --[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 13:00, 7 October 2006 (PDT)

== I have many suggestions ==

Genres, Record Labels, More information of each band (Date started, connections between members of bands(what other bands they're in), and all that other good stuff)

http://www.metal-archives.com

That website is where I'd like to see this one, except that one is metal only, only bad thing

:: The artist page for a band is a good place to add the information you suggest.  The genre thing has been discussed time, and time again.  It's just very hard to absolutely categorize a band, album, or song as one specific genre, as people usually have their own interpretation of what a song is and many are ambiguous.  So, with the exception of genre, feel free to add whatever information you want to the appropriate level.  It's why we have artist, album, and song pages.  Information that applies to the band as a whole goes on the artist page.  Information that leaks down and is specific to an album, goes on the album page, and then information on the song, goes on the song page.  If you read the rest of the talk page, you can see the comments on genre already.  I'm formally against it due to how little value it actually adds vs how much more work it will be moderating disputes about genre.  There is however an authoratitive source of genre (even if it's wrong sometimes) in AMG.  If the community wants to start adding genre, I can see that as the only workable solution for avoiding lots of conflict and dispute. --[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 05:12, 30 October 2006 (PST)

:: We already have methods for addressing bands with the same name in place, it's just not encountered often enough for most people to be aware of it.  It should be in the guides however.  I'm not sure what you're addressing with your 'but', perhaps the genre issue.  People should be able to tell the difference anyways if the proper information is put on the artist page.  Even if we adapted the same method we've chosen for some other articles that have namespace collisions (just append information.) it would still be rather clear and easy to find the particular band you were looking for. :) --[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 08:33, 1 November 2006 (PST)

==Foreign Language 2==
What is becoming quickly annoying is the level of Japanese support. I have found it possible to edit a page and include Japanese, but upon saving, if the page edit is reopened every Japanese character is replaced with a question mark. Upon following a link on said page (links are all in Roman letters), and creating a page, all of the Japanese on the original is broken, an any other pages I have worked with appear to be broken. But hard refreshing itself won't turn the Japanese into question marks. This has become beyond frustrating, especially as I wanted to edit these articles to make the original script more accessible, which is something I wish were more common when looking for my foreign music lyrics online as it is. Is it not possible to fix this?

::: Well, I've found a workaround, hopefully a temporary one though. This [http://code.cside.com/3rdpage/us/unicode/converter.html  convertor] takes extended ASCII and non-Latin characters and puts them into decimal/hex. Both notations work on this wiki and are unaffected by the problem I've had before. Problem with this site is that it's only IE compatible. IEtab for Firefox works just fine, and I haven't tested spoofing the browser info to see if any browser will work just well with it.

== Statistics ==
Is there any way to change some of the [[Special:Statistics|statistics]] parameters? According those we have only  9,000 &quot;valid&quot; articles, even though we have long ago surpassed 20,000 lyrics pages. It seems the problem is that the threshold for [[Special:Shortpages|short pages]] is to high, as it currently lists over 23,000 pages... --[[User:Attendant|Attendant]] 06:16, 10 December 2006 (PST)

:Not as far as I know. --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 15:34, 10 December 2006 (PST)

:Looks like those aren't actually lyrics at all though, so why would we have them in the stats?  A little sketchy isn't it?  We should prolly change that before someone calls us on it.  Just click the links from [[Special:Shortpages|short pages]] and you'll see what i mean. --[[User:88.198.180.62|88.198.180.62]] 23:38, 10 December 2006 (PST)

::You're as wrong as the statistics. ''The majority of those pages are lyrics''. Look from [{{SERVER}}/index.php?title=Special:Shortpages&amp;limit=500&amp;offset=2000 offset=2,000] with 500 results: there's 100 album pages and ''400 song pages''. Now considering that these is only a 500 pages sample from the over 23,000 pages listed as short and that since those pages are sorted by ascending size, the further you go the shorter the chance they correspond to album pages (skip over to [{{SERVER}}/index.php?title=Special:Shortpages&amp;limit=500&amp;offset=10000 offset=10,000] and you'll found only 25 albums and 475 lyrics pages) I think it's pretty obvious that we're not stretching any numbers.

:::I would be happy to change the threshold for what constitutes a &quot;short page&quot;, if I could, but I'm not sure if it's even possible to do so.

:Yes, add them to the ''deletion'' category with '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{deletion}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''. On another note, '''follow the [[Help:Standards#Capitalization|capitalization rule]]'''. It helps to avoid duplicated pages such as those. --[[User:Attendant|Attendant]] 18:50, 17 December 2006 (PST)

Is there much difference between this site and [http://www.lyricwiki.org/Main_Page LyricWiki.org]? If not, then I suggest a merge of the wikis. [[User:72.234.6.235|72.234.6.235]] 17:36, 17 December 2006 (PST)

&lt;lyrics&gt;Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh take it take it all away
Ooh ooh ooh ooh - ooh take my breath away - ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh you take my breath away

Look into my eyes and you'll see
I'm the only one
You've captured my love
Stolen my heart
Changed my life
Everytime you make a move
You destroy my mind
And the way you touch
I lose control and shiver deep inside
You take my breath away

You can reduce me to tears
With a single sigh
(Please don't cry anymore)
Every breath that you take
Any sound that you make
Is a whisper in my ear
I could give up all my life for just one kiss
I would surely die
If you dismiss me from your love
You take my breath away

So please don't go
Don't leave me here all by myself
I get ever so lonely from time to time
I will find you
Anywhere you go, I'll be right behind you
Right until the ends of the Earth
I'll get no sleep till I find you to tell you
That you just take my breath away

I will find you
Anywhere you go
Right until the ends of the Earth
I'll get no sleep till I find you to
Tell you when I've found you -
I love you

Take my breath, take my breath (x8)
Take my breath away&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;You might believe in Heaven
I would not care to say
For every star in Heaven
There's a sad soul here today
Wake up in the morning with a good face
Stare at the moon all day
Lonely as a whisper on a star chase
Does anyone care anyway
For all the prayers in Heaven
So much of life's this way

Did we leave our way behind us
Such a long long way behind us
Who knows when, now who knows where
Where the light of day will find us?
Look for the day

Take heart, my friend, we love you
Though it seems like you're alone
A million lights above you
Smile down upon your home
Oh, Hurry put your troubles in a suitcase
Come let the new child play
Lonely as a whisper on a star chase
I'm leaving here, I'm long away
For all the stars in Heaven
I would not live
I could not live this way

Did we leave our way behind us
Such a long long way behind us
Leave it for some hopeless lane
Such a long long way
Such a long long way
Such a long long away
I'm looking for
Looking for that day&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Bring out the charge of the love brigade
There is spring in the air once again
Drink to the sound of the song parade
There is music and love everywhere
Give a little love to me (I want it)
Take a little love from me, I want to share it with you
I feel like a millionaire

Once we were mad, we were happy
We spent all our days holding hands together
Do you remember, my love?
How we danced and played
In the rain we laid
Wish that we could stay there, forever and ever

Now I am sad
You are so far away
I sit counting the hours day by day
Come back to me, how I long for your love
Come back to me - be happy like we used to be
Come back, come back to me
Come back, come back to me - aah
Oh, come back to me, oh my love
How I long for your love - won't you come back to me, yeah
My fine friend - take me wiz you unt love me forever
My fine friend - forever - forever

Bring out the charge of the love brigade
There is spring in the air once again
Drink to the sound of the song parade
There is music and love everywhere
Give a little love to me (I want it)
Take a little love from me, I want to share it with you

Come back, come back to me - make me feel
You make me feel like a millionaire&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Ooh, music is playing in the darkness
And a lantern goes swinging by
Shadows flickering
My heart's jittering
Just you and I

Not tonight
Come tomorrow
When everything's sunny and bright (sunny and bright)
No no no
Come tomorrow
'Cos then we'll be waiting for the moonlight

We'll go walking in the moonlight
Walking in the moonlight

Ooh, Laughter ringing in the darkness
People drinking for days gone by
Time don't mean a thing
When you're by my side
Please stay a while

Ooh, you know I never could foresee the future years
You know I never could see where life was leading me
But will we be together for ever
What will be my love, can't you see that I just don't know, don't care

No no no not tonight
Come tomorrow
Everything's gonna be sunny and bright
Wait and see
If tomorrow
We'll be as happy as we're feeling tonight

We'll go walking (Oh we'll be, we'll be happy) in the moonlight
Walking in the moonlight

Ooh, I can hear the music in the darkness
Floating softly to where we lie
No more questions now
Let's enjoy tonight
Just you and I
Ooh, just you and I
Mmm, just you and I

Ooh, can't you see that we've gotta be together
Be together just you and I
Just you and I
No more questions
Just you and I&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I'm a simple man
With a simple name
From this soil my people came
In this soil remain
Oh yeah, oh yeah

We made us our shoes
We trod soft on the land
But the immigrant built roads
On our blood and sand
Oh yeah, oh yeah

White man, White man
Don't you see the light behind your blackened skies
White man, White man
You took away the sight to blind my simple eyes
White man, White man
Where you gonna hide
From the hell you've made?

Oh the Red man knows war
With his hands and his knives
On the bible you swore
Fought your battle with lies
Oh yeah

Leave my body in shame
Leave my soul in disgrace
But by every God's name
Say your prayers for your race
Oh yeah

White man, White man
Our country was green and all our rivers wide
White man, White man
You came with a gun and soon our children died
White man, White man
Don't you give a light for the blood you've shed
Oooh yeah

Oh White man, White man (White man)
White man, White man
Fought your battle with lies, yeah
White man, White man - but weren't too civilised yeah
White man, White man
Take a look around
Every skin and bone
Hey

What is left of your dream?
Just the words on your stone
A man who learned how to teach
Then forgot how to learn
Oh yeah&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;It's the sad-eyed, goodbye, yesterday moments I remember
It's the bleak street, weak-kneed partings I recall
It's the mistier mist
The hazier days
The brighter sun
And the easier lays
There's all the more reason for laughing and crying
When you're younger and life isn't too hard at all

It's the fantastic drowse of the afternoon Sundays
That bored you to rages of tears
The unending pleading, to waste all your good times
In thoughts of your middle aged years
It's a vertical hold, all the things that you're told
For the everyday hero it all turns to zero
And there's all the more reason for living or dying
When you're young and your troubles are all very small

Out here on the street
We'd gather and meet
And scuff up the sidewalk with endlessly restless feet
And half of the time
We'd broaden our minds
More in the pool hall than we did in the school hall
With the downtown chewing-gum bums
Watching the nightlife, the lights and the fun

Never wanted to be the boy next door
Always thought I'd be something more
But it ain't easy for a small town boy
It ain't easy at all
Thinkin' it right, doin' it wrong
It's easier from an armchair
Waves of alternatives wash at my sleepiness
Have my eggs poached for breakfast I guess

I think I'll be Clint Eastwood
Oh no, Jimi Hendrix, he looks good
Let's try William The Conqueror
Now who else do I like?&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;When I'm gone
No need to wonder if I ever think of you
The same moon shines
The same wind blows
For both of us, and time is but a paper moon...
Be not gone

Though I'm gone
It's just as though I hold the flower that touches you
A new life grows
The blossom knows
There's no one else could warm my heart as much as you...
Be not gone

Let us cling together as the years go by
Oh my love, my love
In the quiet of the night
Let our candle always burn
Let us never lose the lessons we have learned

Teo torriatte konomama iko
Aisuruhito yo
Shizukana yoi ni
Hikario tomoshi
Itoshiki oshieo idaki

Hear my song
Still think of me the way you've come to think of me
The nights grow long
But dreams live on
Just close your pretty eyes and you can be with me...
Dream on

Teo torriatte konomama iko
Aisuruhito yo
Shizukana yoi ni
Hikario tomoshi
Itoshiki oshieo idaki

When I'm gone
They'll say we're all fools and we don't understand
Oh be strong
Don't turn your heart
We're all
You're all
For all
For always

Let us cling together as the years go by
Oh my love, my love
In the quiet of the night
Let our candle always burn
Let us never lose the lessons we have learned&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Outta my way
Outta my day
Out of your mind and into mine

Into no one
Into not one
Into your step but out of time

Headstrong
What's wrong?
I've already heard this song before
You arrived, but now it's time to kiss your ass goodbye

Dragging me down
Why you around?
So useless

It ain't my fall
It ain't my call
It ain't my bitch
It ain't my bitch

Down on the sun
Down and no fun
Down and out, where the hell you been?

Damn it all down
Damn it unbound
Damn it all down to hell again

Stand tall
Can't fall
Never even bend at all before
You arrived, but now it's time to kiss your ass goodbye

Dragging me down
Why you around?
So useless

It ain't my fall
It ain't my call
It ain't my bitch

Outta my way

Outta my way
Outta my day
Out of your mind and into mine

Into no one
Into not one
Into your step but out of time

Headstrong
What's wrong?
I've already heard this song before
You arrived, but now it's time to kiss your ass goodbye
And now it's time to kiss your ass goodbye

Dragging me down
While you around?
So useless

It ain't my fall
It ain't my call
It ain't my bitch

No way but down
Why you're around
No fooling

It ain't my smile
It ain't my style
It ain't my bitch
Oh, it ain't mine

Ain't mine
Your kind
You're stepping out of time

Ain't mine
Your kind
You're stepping out of time

Taking me down
Why you around
No fooling

It ain't my fall
It ain't my call
It ain't my bitch
You ain't mine&lt;/lyrics&gt;

I'm gonna be the one who breaks you
Put the screws to you, yeah, my way
Yeah, come on and come on, come and make my day
Make my day

Got some hell to pay, I steal your thunder
The joy of violent movement, pulls you under
Bite the bullet, well hard
Yeah, but I die harder, so go too far
Too far

Friction, fusion, retribution
I can't hear you, talk to me
I can't hear you, so talk to me
I can't hear you, are you talking to me?
I can't hear you, are you talking to me?
I can't hear you, time to meet my lord
I can't hear you, talk to two by four

I'm gonna make you, shake you, take you
I'm gonna be that one who breaks you
Put the screws to you, my way
Hey, come on and come on, come and make my day
Make my day

Friction, fusion, retribution
I can't hear you, talk to me
I can't hear you, come talk to me
I can't hear you, are you talking to me?
I can't hear you, are you talking to me?
I can't hear you, time to meet my lord
I can't hear you, talk to two by four

Talk to two by four
It don't take no more

Friction, fusion, retribution
I'm gonna make you talk to me
I'm gonna trick you, so talk to me
I can't hear you, are you talking to me?
I can't hear you, you talking to me?
I can't hear you, time to meet my lord
I can't hear you, talk to two by four
She don't take no more&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Open door, so I walk inside
Close my eyes, find my place
to hide
And I shake as I take it in
Let the show begin

Open my eyes just to have them close again
Well on my way, but on my way to where I've been
It swallows me as it takes me in its fog
I twist away as I give this world the nod

Open door, so I walk inside
Close my eyes, find my place to hide
And I shake as I take it in
Let the show begin

Open my eyes just to have them closed once again
Don't want control
As it takes me down and down and down again
Is that the moon or just a light that lights this dead-end street?
Is that you there or just another demon that I meet?

The higher you are
The farther you fall
The longer the walk
The farther you crawl
My body, my temple
This temple, it tilts
Step into the house that Jack built

The higher you are
The farther you fall
The longer the walk
The farther you crawl
My body, my temple
This temple, it tilts
Yes, this is the house that Jack built

Open door, yes, I walk inside
Swallow me so the pain subsides
And I shake as I take the sin
Let the show begin

The higher you are
The farther you fall
The longer the walk
The farther you crawl
My body, my temple
This temple, it tilts
Yes, this is the house that
Jack built

The higher you are
The farther you fall
The longer the walk
The farther you crawl
My body, my temple
This temple, it tilts
Yes, I am, I am, I am

Open my eyes
It swallows me
Is that you there
I twist away
Away
Away
Away&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Where do I take this pain of mine?
I run, but it stays right by my side

So tear me open, pour me out
There's things inside that scream and shout
And the pain still hates me
So hold me until it sleeps

Just like the curse, just like the stray
You feed it once and now it stays
Now it stays

So tear me open but beware
There's things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me until I'm clean

It grips you, so hold me
It stains you, so hold me
It hates you, so hold me
It holds you, so hold me
Until it sleeps

So tell me why you've chosen me
Don't want your grip,
don't want your greed
Don't want it

I'll tear me open, make you gone
No more can you hurt anyone
And the fear still shakes me
So hold me until it sleeps

It grips you, so hold me
It stains you, so hold me
It hates you, so hold me
It holds you, holds you,
holds you until it sleeps

I don't want it

So tear me open but beware
There's things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me till I'm clean

I'll tear me open,
make you gone
No longer will you hurt anyone
And the hate still shapes me
So hold me until it sleeps
Until it sleeps&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Wish I may, wish I might
Have this I wish tonight
Are you satisfied?
Dig for gold, dig for fame
You dig to make your name
Are you pacified?

All the wants you waste
All the things you've chased

Then it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger
But there's no one around
Just want one thing
Just to play the king
But the castle's crumbled
And you're left with just a name

Where's your crown,
King Nothing?
Where's your crown?

Hot and cold, bought and sold
A heart as hard as gold
Are you satisfied?
Wish I might, wish I may
You wish your life away
Are you pacified?

All the wants you waste
All the things you've chased

Then it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger
But there's no one around
Just want one thing
Just to play the king
But the castle's crumbled
And you're left with just a name
Where's your crown, King Nothing?
Where's your crown?

I wish I may, I wish I might
Have this wish I wish tonight
I want that star, I want it now
I want it all and I don't care how

Careful what you wish
Careful what you say
Careful what you wish, you may regret it
Careful what you wish, you just might get it

Then it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger
But there's no one around
Just want one thing
Just to play the king
But the castle's crumbled
And you're left with just a name

Where's your crown, King Nothing?

Nothing

You're just nothing
Where's your crown, King Nothing?
You're just nothing
Absolutely nothing

Off to never-never land&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I'm digging my way
I'm digging my way to something
I'm digging my way to something better

I'm pushing to stay
I'm pushing to stay with something
I'm pushing to stay with something better

I'm sowing the seeds
I'm sowing the seeds I've taken
I'm sowing the seeds I take for granted

This thorn in my side
This thorn in my side is from the tree
This thorn in my side is from the tree I've planted

It tears me and I bleed
And I bleed

Caught under wheels' roll
I take the leech, I'm bleeding me
Can't stop to save my soul
I take the leash that's leading me
I'm bleeding me
I can't take it
Caught under wheels' roll
The bleeding of me
Of me
The bleeding of me

I am the beast that feeds the feast
I am the blood, I am release

Come make me pure
Bleed me a cure
I'm caught, I'm caught, I'm caught under

Caught under wheels' roll
I take that leech, I'm bleeding me
Can't stop to save my soul
I take the leash that's leading me
I'm bleeding me
I can't take it
I can't take it
I can't take it
The bleeding of me

I'm digging my way
I'm digging my way to something
I'm digging my way to something better

I'm pushing to stay
I'm pushing to stay with something
I'm pushing to stay with something better
With something better&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Mama, they try and break me

The window burns to light the way back home
A light that warms no matter where they've gone
They're off to find the hero of the day
But what if they should fall by someone's wicked way?

Still the window burns
Time so slowly turns
And someone there is sighing
Keepers of the flames
Do you feel your name?
Did you hear your babies crying?

Mama, they try and break me
Still they try and break me

Excuse me while I tend to how
I feel
These things return to me that still seem real
Now, deservingly, this easy chair
But the rocking stopped by wheels of despair

Don't want your aid
But the fist I make
For years can't hold or feel
No, I'm not all me
So please excuse me while I tend to how I feel

But now the dreams and waking screams
That ever last the night
So build the wall, behind it crawl
And hide until it's light
So can you hear your babies crying now?

Still the window burns
Time so slowly turns
And someone there is sighing
Keepers of the flames
Did you feel your names?
Did you hear your babies crying?

But now the dreams and waking screams
That ever last the night
So build a wall, behind it crawl
And hide until it's light
So can't you hear your babies crying now?

Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama they try
Mama they try&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;The man takes another bullet
He keeps them all within
He must seek no matter how it hurts
So don't fool again

He thinks the answer's cold
and in his hand
He takes his medicine
The man takes another bullet
He's been fooled again

Uncross your arms
Take and throw them to the cure, say,
&quot;I do believe&quot;

Uncross your arms now
Take them to it, say
&quot;I do believe&quot;
&quot;I do believe&quot;

The lies tempt her and she follows
Again she lets him in
She must believe to fill the hollow
She's been fooled again

Uncross your arms
Take and throw them to
the cure, say,
&quot;I do believe&quot;

Uncross your arms now
Take them to it, say,
&quot;I do believe&quot;
&quot;Yeah, I do believe&quot;

Betting on the cure
It must get better than this
Betting on the cure
Everyone's got to have the sickness
'Cause everyone seems to need the cure
Precious cure

Betting on the cure
'Cause it must get better than this
Betting on the cure
Everyone's got to have the sickness
'Cause everyone seems to need the cure
Precious cure

&quot;I do believe&quot;

Betting on the cure
It must get better than this
Need to feel secure
It's got to get better than this
It must get better than this
Betting on the cure
Everyone's got to have the sickness
'Cause everyone seems to need the cure

&quot;I do believe&quot;&lt;/lyrics&gt;

Oh, poor twisted me
I feast on sympathy
I chew on suffer
I chew on agony

Swallow whole the pain
Oh, it's too good to be
That all this misery
Is just for, oh, poor twisted me
Poor twisted me

Poor mistreated me
Poor mistreated me
I drown without a sea
Lungs fill with sorrow
Lungs fill with misery

Inhaling the deep, dark blue
Oh, woe is me
Such a burden to be
The poor mistreated me

To finally reach the shore, survive the storm
Now you're bare and cold, the sea was warm
So warm, you bathe your soul again

Baby, again and again and again

You finally reached the shore, survived the storm
Now you're bare and cold, the sea was warm
So warm, you bathe your soul again

Good to feel my friend
Oh, woe is me
Such a burden to be
Oh, poor twisted me
Yo, poor twisted me&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Good day. How do?
And I send a smile to you
Don't waste, waste your breath
And I won't waste my hate on you

Ain't gonna waste my hate
Ain't gonna waste my hate on you
I think I'll keep it for myself

Ain't gonna give no more
Ain't got the time to help you score
I think it's time you pleased yourself
Yourself

Good day. How do?
And I send a smile to you
Don't waste, waste your breath
And I won't waste my hate on you
Waste my hate on you
Hate

You think you're worthy now?
You think enough to even raise the brow
And to laugh and tip that two-pronged crown?

Well I see my hands, I see my feet
I feel that blood that pumps in beat
But where the hell's my mind going now?
Dead gone now

Good day. How do?
And I send a smile to you
Don't waste, waste your breath
And I won't waste my hate on you
Waste my hate on you

Think I'll keep it for myself

Hate

Ain't gonna waste my hate
But I'm so greedy when they say
Better to give than to receive

Ain't gonna waste my hate
Ain't got time to waste my hate on you
I think I'll keep it all for myself
For myself

Good day. How do?
And I send a smile to you
Don't waste, waste your breath
And I won't waste my hate on you
Waste my hate on you

Think I'll keep it for myself

Hate&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Mama, she has taught me well
Told me when I was young
Son, your life's an open book
Don't close it 'fore it's done
The brightest flame burns
quickest
That's what I heard her say
A son's heart's owed to mother
But I must find my way

Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or, let this heart be still

&quot;Rebel,&quot; my new last name
Wild blood in my veins
Apron strings around my neck
The mark that still remains
I left home at an early age
Of what I heard was wrong
I never asked forgiveness
But what is said is done

Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or let this heart be still

Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
So let this heart be still

Mama, now I'm coming home
I'm not all you wished of me
A mother's love for her son
Unspoken, help me be
I took your love for granted
And all the things you said to me
I need your arms to welcome me
But a cold stone's all I see

Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or let this heart be still

Let my heart go
Mama, let my heart go
You never let my heart go
So let this heart be still

Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
So let this heart be still&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned
Find me guilty of the life I feel within

When I'm branded, this mark of shame
Should I look down, disgraced, or straight ahead and know that you must blame?

I am the secret
I am the sin
I am the guilty
And I am, I am the thorn within

Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned
Find me guilty when true guilt is from within

So point your fingers, point right at me
For I am shadows and will follow you, one and the same are we

I am the secret
I am the sin
I am the guilty
And I am, I am the thorn within

I do your time, I take your fall
I'm branded guilty for us all

So point your fingers, point right at me
For I am shadows and will follow you, one and the same are we

I am your secrets
I am your sin
I am your guilty
And I am, I am the thorn within

I am the thorn within
I am the thorn within&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Story starts, quiet town
Small-town boy, big-time frown
Never talks, never plays
Different path, lost his way

Then streets of red—red, I'm afraid—
There's no confetti, no parade
Nothing happens in this boring place
But, oh my God, how it all did change

Now they all pray,
&quot;Blood stain, wash away&quot;

He said,
&quot;Lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way&quot;

I heard it
He said,
&quot;Lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way&quot;
Oh, please wash away
But blood stained the sun red today

I always said something's wrong
With little, strange Ronnie Long
Never laughed, never smiled
Talked alone for miles and miles and miles

&quot;Gallow calls, son,&quot; I say
Keep your smile and laugh all day
Think once again in this boring place
For little boys, how they soon change
And they all pray,
&quot;Blood stain, wash away&quot;

He said,
&quot;I lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way&quot;
I heard it
He said,
&quot;I lost my way
This bloody day
I lost my way&quot;
Oh, please wash away
But blood stained the sun red today

Well, all the green things died when Ronnie moved to this place
He said, “Don't you dare ask why I'm cursed to wear this face”
Now we all know why the children called him Ronnie Frown
When he pulled that gun from his pocket they all fall down, down, down

He said,
&quot;Lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way&quot;

Yeah, yeah
I heard it
He screamed,
&quot;Lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way&quot;

Oh, please wash away
But blood stained the sun red today

All things wash away
And they all fall down
But blood stained the sun today

All things wash away
And they all fall down
But blood stained the sun today&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;And now I wait my whole lifetime for you
And now I wait my whole lifetime for you

I ride the dirt, I ride the tide for you
I search the outside, search inside for you

To take back what you left me
I know I'll always burn to be
The one who seeks so I may find
And now I wait my whole lifetime

Outlaw of torn
Outlaw of torn
And I'm torn

So on I wait my whole lifetime for you
So on I wait my whole lifetime for you

The more I search, the more my need for you
The more I bless, the more I bleed for you

You make me smash the clock and feel
I'd rather die behind the wheel
Time was never on my side
So on I wait my whole lifetime
Outlaw of torn
Outlaw of torn
Outlaw of torn
And I'm torn

Hear me
And if I close my mind in fear
Please pry it open
See me
And if my face becomes sincere
Beware
Hold me
And when I start to come undone
Stitch me together
Save me
And when you see me strut
Remind me of what left this outlaw torn&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;It's been...
One week since you looked at me,
Cocked your head to the side and said &quot;I'm angry.&quot;
Five days since you laughed at me,
Saying &quot;Get back together, come back and see me.&quot;
Three days since the living room,
I realized it's all my fault but couldn't tell you.
Yesterday, you'd forgiven me,
But it'll still be two days 'til I say &quot;I'm sorry.&quot;

Hold it now and watch the hoodwink,
As I make you stop, think
You'll think you're lookin' at Aquaman.
I summon fish to the dish, although I like the chalet Swiss,
I like the sushi 'cause it's never touched a frying pan.
Hot like wasabi when I bust rhymes,
Big like Leanne Rimes,
Because I'm all about value.
Burt Kaempfert's got the mad hits, 
You try to match wits.
You try to hold me but I bust through.
Gonna make a break and take a fake
I like a stinkin' achin' shake
I like vanilla, it's the finest of the flavors.
Gotta see the show 
'cause then you'll know 
the vertigo is gonna grow 
'cause it's so dangerous you'll have to sign a waiver.

How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad?
Trying hard not to smile though I feel bad.
I'm the kinda guy who laughs at a funeral.
Can't understand what I mean?  Well you soon will.
I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve.
I have a history of taking off my shirt.

It's been...
One week since you looked at me,
Threw your arms in the air and said &quot;You're crazy!&quot;
Five days since you tackled me,
I've still got the rugburns on both my knees.
It's been...  
Three says since the afternoon,
You realized it's not my fault, not a moment too soon.
Yesterday, you'd forgiven me,
And now I sit back and wait 'til you say you're sorry.

Chickadee China the Chinese chicken,
You have a drumstick and your brain stops tickin'.
Watchin' X-Files with no lights on,
We're dans le maison, 
I hope the smoking man's in this one.
Like Harrison Ford I'm getting frantic.
Like Sting I'm tantric.
Like Snickers guaranteed to satisfy.
Like Kurosawa I make mad films.
'K, I don't make films,
But if I did they'd have a samurai.
Gonna get a set of better clubs,
Gonna find the kind with tiny nubs,
Just so my irons aren't always flying off the backswing.
Gotta get in tune with Sailor Moon,
Cause that cartoon has got the &quot;boom&quot; anime babes,
That make me think the wrong thing.

How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad?
Trying hard not to smile though I feel bad.
I'm the kinda guy who laughs at a funeral.
Can't understand what I mean - you soon will.
I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve.
I have a history of losing my shirt.

It's been...
One week since you looked at me,
Dropped your arms to your sides and said &quot;I'm sorry.&quot;
Five days since I laughed at you,
And said &quot;You just did just what I thought you were gonna do.&quot;
Three days since the living room,
We realized we're both to blame, but what could we do?
Yesterday, you just smiled at me,
'Cause it'll still be two days 'til we say we're sorry.

(It'll still be two days 'til we say we're sorry.)
(It'll still be two days 'til we say we're sorry.)
(Birchmont Stadium, home of the Robbie.)&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I met you,
Before the fall of Rome.
And I begged you,
To let me tak you home.
You were wrong.
I was right.
You said &quot;Goodbye.&quot;
I said &quot;Good night!&quot;

Chorus:
Woo-ooo-hoo!
It's all been done!
Woo-ooo-hoo!
It's all been done.
Woo-ooo-hoo!
It's all been...
done...
before.

I knew you,
Before the West was won.
And I heard you say,
&quot;The past was much more fun.&quot;
You go your way,
I go mine.
But I see you next time!

Chorus

If I put my fingers here,
And if I say &quot;I love you dear.&quot;
And if I play the same three chords,
Will you just yawn and say... (Ahhh!)

Chorus


Alone and bored,
On a thirtyth century night.
Will I see you,
On &quot;The Price is Right?&quot;
Will I cry?
Will I smile?
As you run down the aisle?

Chorus 3x&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;The hydro-field cuts through my neighborhood.
Somehow that always just made me feel good.
I can put a spare bulb in my hand,
And light up my yard.

Late at night when the wires in the walls,
Sing in tune with the din of the falls,
I'm conducting it all in my sleep,
To light this whole town.

Chorus:
If you question what I would do,
To get over and be with you.
Lift you up over everything,
To light up my ro-ooo-oom.

There's a shopping card in the ravine.
Foam on the creek is like pop n' iced cream.
Field full of tires that is always on fire,
To light my way home.

There are luxuries we can't afford,
But at our house we never get bored,
'Cause we can dance to the radio station,
That plays in our teeth.

Chorus
My ro-ooo-oom

The hydro-field cuts through my neighborhood.
Somehow that always just made me feel good.
I can put a spare bulb in my hand,
And light up my yard.
(Light up my yard.)
(Lights in my yard.)
(Light up my ya-aaa-ard.)2x
(Da da da daaa-aah)7x&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;If I were you...
(And I wish that I were you.)
All the things I'd do,
To make myself turn blue.

I suppose,
I'd start by removing all my clothes,
Tie my pantyhoes,
Around my neck.

Chorus:
I'll be that girl,
And you would be right over.
And If I were a field,
You would be in clover.
And if I were the sun,
You would be in shadow.
And if I had a gun,
There'd be no tomorrow.

If you will not have me as myself,
Perhaps as someone else,
Perhaps as you, I'll be worth noticing.

Then even a eunuch won't resist,
The magic of a kiss,
From such as me.

Chorus

It's time to kick off your shoes,
Learn how to choose sadness.
It's time to throw off those chains,
Addle our brains with madness.

'Cause we've got plenty of time,
To grow old and die,
But when at last your beauty's faded,
You'll be glad that I have waited,
For you...

When you're done,
With being beautiful and young,
When that course is run,
Then come to me.

Chorus
There'd be no tomorrow. (5x)&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I've informed you to leave.
'Cause I can't afford to lose more sleep.
I get ill and I get tired.
So I'll try to rest if you'll stand guard.

Chorus:
     (Doo doo da doo, doo da doo-doo, doo-o-oh)
     (Doo doo da doo, doo-oo doo-ooh)


I've informed you to leave.
'Cause I can't stand to hear you breathe.
I chew up and I choke down,
Scraps you choose to leave around.

Chrous

Apparitions still won't leave me alone.
It's as if you never left.
How am I supposed to remember you,
When you won't let me forget?

I've informed you to leave (I've informed you to leave.)
'Cause I can't afford to lose more sleep. (I can't afford yo lose more sleep.)
There's your shoes and there's the door. (There's your shoes and there's the door.)
Please don't come here anymore. (Please don't come.)

Chorus&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Alcohol, my permanent accessory.
Alcohol, a party-time necessity.
Alcohol, alternative to feeling like yourself.
Oh alcohol, I still drink to your health.

I love you more,
Then I did the week before,
I discovered alcohol.

(That's what we're talkin')

Forget the cafe latte,
Screw the raspberry iced tea.
A Malibu and Coke for you,
A G&amp;T for me.

Alcohol, your songs resolve,
Like my life never will,
When someone else is picking up the bill.

I love you more,
Then I did the week before,
I discovered alcohol.
Oooh alcohol,
Would you please forgive me?
For while I cannot love myself,
I'll use something else.

I thought that alcohol was just for those with nothing else to do.
I thought that drinking just to get drunk was a waste of precious booze.
But now I know that there's a time and there's a place where I can choose,
To walk the fine line between self-control and self-abuse.


I love you more,
Then I did the week before,
I discovered alcohol.
Would you please ignore
That you found me on the floor,
Trying on your camisole?
Oooh alcohol,
Would you please forgive me?
For while I cannot love myself,
I'll use something else.

(Would you please forgive me?)2x&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I will break into your thoughts
With what's written on my heart
I will break, break

I'm so sick, infected with
Where I live
Let me live without this
Empty bliss, selfishness
I'm so sick
I'm so sick

If you want more of this
We can push out, sell out, die out
So you'll shut up
And stay sleeping
With my screaming in your itching ears

I'm so sick, infected with
Where I live
Let me live without this
Empty bliss, selfishness
I'm so sick
I'm so sick

Hear it, I'm screaming it
You're heeding to it now
Hear it, I'm screaming it
You tremble at this sound

You sink into my clothes
This invasion makes me feel
Worthless, hopeless, sick

I'm so sick, infected with
Where I live
Let me live without this
Empty bliss, selfishness
I'm so, I'm so sick

I'm so sick, infected with
Where I live
Let me live without this
Empty bliss, selfishness
I'm so (I'm so)
I'm so sick (I'm so sick)
I'm so (I'm so)
I'm so sick (I'm so sick)&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Telling Layla's story spoken
About how all her bones are broken
Hammers fall on all the pieces
Two months in the cover creases

Here she stands today 
In her brilliant shining world

Fully alive, more than most
Ready to smile and love life
Fully alive and she knows
How to believe in futures

All my complaints shrink to nothing
I'm ashamed of all my somethings
She's glad for one day of comfort
Only because she has suffered

Fully alive, more than most
Ready to smile and love life
Fully alive and she knows
How to believe in futures

Fully alive, more than most
Ready to smile and love life
Fully alive and she knows
How to believe in futures

Fully alive, more than most
Ready to smile and love life
Fully alive and she knows
How to believe in futures&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Sick of circling the same road
Sick of bearing the guilt
Open the windows to cool off
Heat pours in instead

Perfect in weakness
I'm only perfect in just your strength alone

All my efforts to clean me
Leave me putrid and filthy
How can you look at me
When I can't stand myself?

I'm tired to be honest, I'm nobody

Perfect in weakness
I'm only perfect in just your strength alone
Perfect in weakness
I'm only running in just your strength alone

I tried to kill you. You tried to save me
You save me. You save me. You save me

Perfect in weakness
I'm only perfect in just your strength alone
Perfect in weakness
I'm only running in just your strength alone&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;The question asked in order
To save her life or take it
The answer no to avoid death
The answer yes would make it, make it

Do you believe in God
Written on the bullet
Say yes to pull the trigger

Do you believe in God
Written on the bullet
And Cassie pulled the trigger

All heads are bowed in silence
To remember her last sentence
She answered him knowing what would happen
Her last words still hanging in the air, in the air

Do you believe in God
Written on the bullet
Say yes to pull the trigger

Do you believe in God
Written on the bullet
And Cassie pulled the trigger

How many will die
I will die
I, I will say yes

Do you believe in God
Written on the bullet
Say yes to pull the trigger

Do you believe in God
Written on the bullet
And Cassie pulled the trigger

Do you believe in God
Do you believe in God
Do you believe in God
And I will pull the trigger&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Sometimes life seems to quiet into paralyzing silence
Like the moonless dark, meant to make me strong
Familiar breath of my old lies
Changed the color in my eyes
Soon he will perferate the fabric of the peaceful by and by

Sorrow lasts through this night
I'll take this piece of you, and hold for all eternity
For just one second I felt whole as you flew right through me

Left alone with only reflections of the memory
To face the ugly girl that's smothering me
Sitting closer than my pain
He knew each tear before it came
And soon he will perforate the fabric of the peaceful by and by

Sorrow lasts through this night
I'll take this piece of you, and hold for all eternity
For just one second I felt whole as you flew right through me

And we kiss each other one more time
And sing this lie that's half way mine
The sword is slicing through the questions so I won't be fooled
By his angel light

Sorrow lasts through this night
I'll take this piece of you and for all eternity
For just one second I felt whole as you flew right though me
And up into the stars

Joy will come&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I'm sorry. I don't mean to remember
It's true that I dream less often
I'm not ashamed of that long December
Your hand's coming down again

I close my eyes and brace myself
I only noticed your face
No matter what you're gonna build my shell
No matter what you're gonna build my shell

I'm falling. I'm shedding my skin
But it's not time I'm told
I am aware of what you mean and by then
I'm only ten years old

I close my eyes and brace myself
I only noticed your face
No matter what you're gonna build my shell
No matter what you're gonna build my shell

My scars are yours today
This story ends so good
I love you and I understand 
That you stood where I stood

I close my eyes and brace myself
I only noticed your face 
No matter what you're gonna break my shell
No matter what you're gonna break my shell

I’m done healing&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;My hands are searching for you
My arms are outstretched towards you
I feel you on my fingertips
My tongue dances behind my lips for you
This fire runs in through my being
Burning, I'm not used to seeing you

I'm alive, I'm alive

I can feel you all around me
Thickening the air I'm breathing
Holding on to what I'm feeling
Savoring this heart that's healing

My hands float up above me
And you whisper you love me
And I begin to fade
Into our secret place
The music makes me sway
The angels singing say
We are alone with you
I am alone and they are too with you

I'm alive, I'm alive

I can feel you all around me
Thickening the air I'm breathing
Holding on to what I'm feeling
Savoring this heart that's healing

And so I cry
The light is white
And I see you

I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive

I can feel you all around me
Thickening the air I'm breathing
Holding on to what I'm feeling
Savoring this heart that's healing

Take my hand I give it to you
Now you own me, all I am
You said you would never leave me
I believe you, I beleive

I can feel you all around me
Thickening the air I'm breathing
Holding on to what I'm feeling
Savoring this heart that's healed&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Here I stand
Empty hands
Wishing my wrists were bleeding
To stop the pain from the beatings

There you stood
Holding me
Waiting for me to notice you

But who are you
You are the truth (you are the truth)
Outscreaming these lies
You are the truth (you are the truth)
Saving my life

The warmth of your embrace
Melts my frostbitten spirit
You speak the truth and I hear it
The words are I love you
And I have to believe in you

But who are you
You are the truth (you are the truth)
Outscreaming these lies
You are the truth (you are the truth)
Saving my life

My hands are open
And you are filling them
Hands in the air
In the air, in the air, in the air

And I worship
And I worship
And I worship
And I worship

You are the truth (you are the truth)
Outscreaming these lies
You are the truth (you are the truth)
Saving my life&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Sometimes I'm a selfish fake
You're always a true friend
I don't deserve you cause I'm not there for you
Please forgive me again

I want to be there for you
Someone you can come to
It runs deeper than my bones
I want to be there for you

Swirling shades of blue
Slow dancing in your eyes
The sun kisses the earth
And I hush my urge to cry

I want to be there for you
Someone you can come to
It runs deeper than my bones
I want to be there for you

'Cause I hear the whispered words
In your masterpiece, beautiful
You speak the unspeakable through
I love you too

I want to be there for you
Someone you can come to
I want to be there for you
And be someone you can come to

The love runs deeper than my bones
And I want to be there for you&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;You can only move as fast as
Who's in front of you
And if you assume 
Just like them
What good will it do
So find out for yourself
So your ignorance
Will stop bleeding through

You can breathe today

So many lies swirling
All around you
You're suffocating
The empty shape in you
Steals your breath
You're suffocating

Logic forces me to believe in this
And I have learned to see
And I can only say what I've seen and heard
And only you can choose
And every choice you make will effect you
Search your own self

You can breathe today

So many lies swirling
All around you
You're suffocating
The empty shape in you
Steals your breath
You're suffocating

So many lies swirling
All around you
You're suffocating
The empty shape in you
Steals your breath
You're suffocating

Breathe

Big enough to fill the void that's inside of you
It's just a breath away

So many lies swirling
All around you
You're suffocating
The empty shape in you
Steals your breath
You're suffocating

So many lies swirling
All around you
You're suffocating
The empty shape in you
Steals your breath
You're suffocating

So many lies swirling
All around you
You're suffocating
The empty shape in you
Steals your breath

Breathe

So many lies swirling
All around you
You're suffocating
Breathe 
The empty shape in you

Breathe today&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;All your twisted thoughts free flow
To everlasting memories
Show soul
Kiss the stars with me
And dread the wait for
Stupid calls returning to us to life
We say to those who are in love
It can't be true 'cause we're too young
I know that's true because so long I was
So in love with you
So I thought

A year goes by
And I can't talk about it

On my knees
Dim lighted room
Thoughts free flow try to consume myself in this
I'm not faithless 
Just paranoid of getting lost or that I might lose
Ignorance is bliss cherish it
Pretty neighborhoods you learn to much to hold
Believe it not
And fight the tears
With pretty smiles and lies about the times

A year goes by
And I can't talk about it
The times weren't right
And I couldn't talk about it

Chorus Romance says goodnight
Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Remember you, remember me
Hurt the first, the last between

Chorus Romance says goodnight
Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Remember you, remember me
Hurt the first, the last, between

And I'm praying that we will see
Something there in between
Then and there that exceeds all we can dream
So we can talk about it

Chorus Romance says goodnight
Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Remember you, remember me
Hurt the first, the last between

Chorus Romance says goodnight
Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Remember you, remember me
Hurt the first, the last healing

And I'm praying that we will see
Something there in between
Then and there that exceeds all we can dream

And all these twisted thoughts I see
Jesus there in between
And all these twisted thoughts I see
Jesus there in between&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;What am I to wake up suddenly and then,
Enroll at the local college?
Earn me a degree and I could work weekends.

If I work real hard,
I could mow your backyard.

I could go to Europe, travel with my friends.
I could blow a thousand deutschmarks,
To get drunk in a pub with some Australians.

Buy a giant backpack.
Sew a flag on the back.

Chorus:
I think never is enough. (Yeah, never is enough.)
I never wanna do that stuff.
I think never is enough. (Yeah, never is enough.)
You never haveta do that stuff.

I never had to spent a summer planting trees.
I never worked my way through a forest,
Inch-by-inch doubled over on my hands and knees.
I never spent a single day in retail.
Telling people what they wanna hear,
Telling people anything to make a sale.

Eating in the food court,
With the old and the bored.

Chorus

The world's your oyster shell,
So what's that funny smell?
You eat the bivalve anyway,
You're sick with salmonella

You get your PhD,
How happy you will be,
When you get a job at Wendy's,
And are honored with employee-of-the-month.

Chorus 3x&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Now I lay me down not to sleep.
I just get tangled in the sheets.
I swim in sweat three inches deep.
I just lay back and claim defeat.

Chapter read and lesson learned.
I turn the lights off while she burn.
So while she's three-hundred degrees,
I throw the sheets off and I freeze.

Chorus:
     Lids down.
     I count sheep.
     I count heartbeats.
     The only thing that counts is that I won't sleep.
     I count down.
     I look around

     (Who needs sleep?)
     Yeah/Well you're never gonna get it.
     (Who needs sleep?)
     Tell me what's that for?
     (Who needs sleep?)
     Be happy with what you're gettin',
     There's a guy who's been awake since the Second World War.
     (2x)

My hands are locked up tight in fists.
My mind is racing filled with lists,
Of things to do and things I've done.
Another sleepless night's begun.

Chorus

There's so much joy in life,
So many pleasures all around.
But the pleasures of insomnia,
Is one I've never found.

With all life has to offer,
There's so much to be enjoyed,
But the pleasures of insomnia,
Are ones I can't avoid.

Chorus, interrupted with &quot;Hullah-Hullah-Hullah&quot;

Who needs sleep?
(Well you're never gonna get it.)
Who needs sleep?
(Tell me what's that for?)
Who needs sleep?
(Be happy with what you're gettin',
There's a guy who's been awake since the Second World War.) (4x)&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I never jumped in and rescued you,
But I wanted to.
I didn't tell you which way to go,
'Cause I thought you'd know.

You had a problem with your new-found wealth.
Brought it on yourself.
I never told you &quot;I told you so,&quot;
But I told you so.

Have to let it go.
It's time to let it go.

Chorus:
Now I can't believe,
It took so long to leave.
Perhaps one day I'll grieve,
Or I never will.

I never told you I agreed with you,
I don't think I do.
I wasn't sure quite what the whole thing meant,
But I'm glad you went.

I never thought that it could be painless,
But it is I guess.
I had myself fooled into needing you.
Did I fool you too?

Have to let it go.
It's time to let it go.

Chorus

Viral infection that can incubate for years.
Caused by affection fallen deep into arrears.
No medication to procure.
Makes me pure.
There's no cure.
I am sure.

I never mentioned how I prayed for you.
Now I payed for you.
I never said I would wait for you.
It's too late for you.

It's time to let it go.

Chorus

Or I never will. (2x)
I never will. (4x)
(Oh why?) (9x)&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;One day I will build a fountain,
Drink and never grow old.
Then I'll market an elixer,
That will eliminate the common cold.

Find your sickness on my list,
Pay up front and make a wish.

One day I will work the animals.
All the tests I'm gonna do.
All my stuff's completely natural.
And when we're done we'll boil 'em down for glue.

That we can use to re-adhere
Your lips to mine if you were here.

Chorus:
     There's a lot I will never do (There's a lot.)
     Some fantastic, I know it's true.
     But none as much as my want to be with you.

I can't stand to wait in line long,
So I built a new machine.
It just measures up the distance,
And then eliminates the folks between.

One day I'll construct a satelite,
And I'll name it after you.
'Cause you were the greatest friend of all,
Except for when you split my lip in two.

To see the look upon your face,
When I launch you into space.

Chorus

Bye-Bye self respect.
I haven't had much of it since you left.
I missed out on the best of you.

Someday I will find the secret to your social chemisty,
Then I'll print it ona T-shirt,
And it'll make you wanna be with me.

And if I wear it past your work,
You'll see other guys are jerks.
Much like pheromones for flies,
You will not avoid my eyes.

Chorus

Bye-Bye self respect.
I haven't had much of it since you left.
I missed out on the best of you.
(2x)

Bye-Bye (Bye-Bye) (3x)&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Life just begun.
My sleeping new son.
His eyes that roll back in his head.
They flutter and dart,
He slows down his heart,
And pictures a world past his bed.

It's hard to believe,
As I watch you breath,
Your mind drifts and weaves.

When you dream,
What do you dream about? (2x)


Do you dream about music,
Or mathematics,
Or planets too far for the eye?

Do you dream about Jesus,
Or quantum mechanics,
Or angels who sing lulabyes?

It's fun to meld pulses,
With lives that he's lived,
With memories he'll learn to ignore.

And when it is closed,
He already knows,
He's forgotten all he knew before.

But when sleep sets in,
History begins.
But the future will win.

When you dream,
What do you dream about? (2x)

Are they color or black and white,
Yiddish or English,
Or languages not yet concieved?

Are they silent or boisterous,
Do you hear noises,
Just loud enough to be perceived?

Do you hear Dell Shannon's,
&quot;Runaway&quot; playing,
On transistor radio waves?

With so little experience,
Your mind not yet cognizant,
Are you wise beyond your few days?

When you dream,
What do you dream about? (5x)
When you dream...&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Let me sail, let me sail,
Let the Orinoco Flow.
Let me reach, let me beach,
On the shores of Tripoli.
Let me sail, let me sail,
Let me crash upon your shore.
Let me reach, let me beach,
Far beyond the Yellow Sea.

Sail away, sail away, sail away! (4x)

From Bisseau to Palau,
In the shade of Avalon.
From Fiji to Tiree
In the Isles of Ebony.
From Peru to Cebu
Feel the power of Babylon.
From Bali to Cali,
Far beneath the Coral Sea.

Turn it up, burn it up, burn it up up up. (3x)

Sail away, sail away, sail away! (4x)

From the North to the South,
Ebudae into Karthoum
From the deep sea of clouds
To the Island of the moon
Carry me on the waves to the lands I've never been. 
Carry me on the waves to the lands I've never seen.

We can sail, we can sail,
Let the Orinoco flow.
We can sail, we can sail,
Sail away, sail away, sail away!
We can stear, we can near,
With Rob Dickins at the wheel.
We can sigh, say goodbye,
Ross and his dependencies
We can sail, we can sail,
Sail away, sail away, sail away!

We can reach, we can beach,
On the shores of Tripoli.
We can sail, we can sail!
Sail away, sail away, sail away!
From Bali to Cali
Far beneath the Coral Sea
We can sail, we can sail!
Sail away, sail away, sail away!
From Bisseau to Palau
In the shade of Avalon
We can sail, we can sail,
Sail away, sail away, sail away!
We can reach, we can beach
Far beyond the Yellow Sea!
We can sail, we can sail,
Sail away, sail away, sail away!
From Peru to Cebu
Feal the Power of Babylon!

We can sail, we can sail,
Sail away, sail away, sail away!

&lt;lyrics&gt;The young stale memories of
Play the role of to your part.
Librarian find me the pole,
The one that kicks your head in
To my own time. Role your own innocence by;
Grab on to my sleeve,
The one that grabs at your ankle.
Debate to understand that we all have a flaw,
Then fail to represent your life as you know it.
God grant you one wish: to turn back the time
Correct and create, making sense of.

Me and my star; Matthew good night.
You know by law when you'll be forgiven.
Maria my star; Matthew good night.
You know my lord when you'll be forgiven.

So they pulled your confidence down
With those verbal discrepancies.
Now and then you'll gain what they've lost
Through a challenge of unpronounced.
Pain is only a pulse: If you just stop feeling it
You might be able to use the very things that make us up.

Me and my star; Matthew good night.
You know by law when you'll be forgiven.
Maria my star; Matthew good night.
You know my lord when you'll be forgiven.

Wait, now, here.  When will you believe?
Me, I'm merely asking you to help me.  When did I say to murder?
Wait, now, here.  Please hear me out.
Time consumer, time consuming, consume me.
Down and out, now.

Me and my star; Matthew good night.
You know by law when you'll be forgiven.
Maria my star; Matthew good night.
You know my lord when you'll be forgiven.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;New Jersey bound.
When sound asleep they'll find you at your most vulnerable.
Poll position.
Speak up, let out
When down the street the corner boys fuck shit up.

Scream loud. Scream sayonara, oh oh oh.
Sweet Josephine will you follow me home?
Scream loud. Scream sayonara, oh oh oh.
Sweet Josephine will you fuck me back home?

Let's fire it up, haha, now.
Let's fire it up, haha, now.
Sayonara!

Don't let them scare you
When you're down on the floor bleeding, bastard;
You'll be getting home real soon
And I'll pray for you, high health.
Don't let them scare you
When you're down on the floor bleeding, bastard;
You'll be getting home real soon.

Speak up, let out, caught in the crossfire
Compared to the step to the bone that might break.
It's too late to find a better way out of this.
With the finest regards that I lost in the cracks of this street.

Scream loud. Scream sayonara, oh oh oh.
Sweet Josephine will you follow me home?
Scream loud. Scream sayonara, oh oh oh.
Sweet Josephine will you fuck me back home?

Let's fire it up, haha, now.
Let's fire it up, haha, now.
Sayonara!

Don't let them scare you
When you're down on the floor bleeding, bastard;
You'll be getting home real soon
And I'll pray for you, high health.
Don't let them scare you
When you're down on the floor bleeding, bastard;
You'll be getting home real soon.

Don't let them scare you.
Take me home when; when you run they'll follow you.
Take me home when; when you run they'll follow you.
Take me home when; when you run they'll follow you.
Take me home when.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Wait for
Everything evil in you comes out.
I'll stay when we'll only motivate sound instead. Sergeant,
Make for the table in hopes that I won't be afraid again.
Call when enabled and send the leader out against. I will
Stage a reenactment in a false pretense. 
Exist, inflict unworthy unconsciousness.
Why debate when the actions supress
Then kill the acquitted?
Listen to the sounds that remain in question
In hopes to solidify a truce
Amongst the children
And the jury that stands the verdict;
Alive here among the dead.

Evil Monstar, show me the things that I've never wanted done.
Evil Monstar, do to me the things I never wanted done.

I...I felt much better than this before.
If they find out, to avoid,
Then the accidents kept it hidden away.
But if they stay...

Blood hungry cannibalistic unfit family ties
In a series of knocks to the young girl's head side.
Come write me a letter and paste it on my refigerator door.
Inspected inspector, I think we've found something over here.

I...I felt much better than this before
If they find out to avoid
Then the accidents kept hidden it away
But if they stay

Jesse, just come look at what your brother did;  Here, he did away with me.
Jesse, just come look at what your brother did;  Here, he did away with me.

Stay until Wednesday and write me a child-like letter pretending
At war here in Thursday; Let's make this our last day at home by the Fence

Would you run?  Would you run?  Would run down past the Fence?
Would you run?  Would you run?  Would run down past the Fence?
And she screamed &quot;Claudio, dear Claudio
I wish, god damn it, we'll make it if you believe.&quot;
And she screamed &quot;Claudio, dear Claudio
I wish, god damn it, we'll make it if you believe.&quot;
K.B.I.
And she screamed &quot;Claudio, dear Claudio
I wish, god damn it, we'll make it if you believe.&quot;&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;We're now up here alone,
Terror on the intercom.
Can someone save us?
Systems malfunction, blast it
This damn machine!
Over and out, Captain.
Something lurks,
creeps on the counter top
Somewhere behind you.
Parasitic cyst, I can't stand to watch;
It's coming up and out of your chest.

Remeber when we were young?

Sit upright on the table.
A photograph of Earth feeding me a way back.
Frightened I tear alone... or maybe not the only one there...
Hello?  Hello?  When it rings, will you answer?
There!  Corner, tall, short stance
It's you!  Come on, kill me!

You made a good friend to me,
But while you were outnumbered
And torn you made us do things.

Oh dear god, I don't feel alive
When you're cut short of misery.
Will you pray it be the end?
Give a look, surprised wide eyes to me.
Then you'll know just what I am;
The scare that triggers your fear.
Come know me in a different light, now.
Come know me as God!

You made a good friend to me,
But while you were outnumbered
And torn you made us do things.

Run sand, in hourglass.
It's my time; Will I be worth?
Spin 'round, carousel
When your horse isn't screwed in.

Oh dear god, I don't feel alive
When you're cut short of misery. (Raise forth. Lost cause)
Will you pray it be the end?
Give a look, surprised wide eyes to me. (Raise forth. Lost cause)
Then you'll know just what I am; (Subtle demise.  The legitimate cry)
The scare that triggers your fear. 
Come know me in a different light, now.
Come know me as God! (Raise forth.  Lost cause)&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Still searching for your call today.
Sit down and structure, will you be the engineer?
Still tired and dreaming out against and overboard.
When pain kills you'll hate me and wait for, or
Then call me crazy and pretend I left us discontent and afraid.
So what?  So I'm crazy.  
Then send me justice and I'll have Paris in flames.

Still searching for your faith in the arm that killed the president.
Relapse, waiting here for.
Still searching for your face in the crowd that killed the president.
Relapse, waiting here for.

I need Mayo.
I won't fail you now
Dear Captain, send the SOS
When we're gonna go down.

I need Mayo.
I won't fail you now (Oh God you're all fucked up for sure)
Dear Captain, send the SOS
When we're gonna go down.

Wound open and squeezing my heart against
This pain inflicts and in passion I bleed for it
But with this, what they gave me; this book
And flint and a match go with it.

Still searching for your faith in the arm that killed the president.
Relapse, waiting here for.
Still searching for your face in the crowd that killed the president.
I'll be waiting here for.

I need Mayo.
I won't fail you now
Dear Captain, send the SOS
When we're gonna go down.

I need Mayo.
I won't fail you now (Oh God you're all fucked up for sure)
Dear Captain, send the SOS
When we're gonna go down.

Have you ever heard the lyrics he sang?
In his thoughtful tranmission the words' lost sentance remains.
Sing his song, sing his song loud.
Structure.  Will you be the engineer?
Where's your song or have you lost the key or tone?

Thank God for your strength.  Will you hold your breath,
Waiting for me to exhale in the short life lived?

Thank God for your strength.  Will you hold your breath,
Waiting for me to exhale in the short life lived?

When you lived?
When you lived?
When you lived?&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;
It's not what you have learned
But what they said about you under your shirt.
You know they never will.
They'll make sense of what you gave them
And now it's all down hill from here.
Well in case you break my fall we're bringing it home.
Patrick, short flip and outside boundary lines.

I'm running you down.
Ooh yeah, well nothing looks right from up here.
Inside out.
I'm still unclear about the things you might have said.

In pieces they stagger indebted
Rush me to the emergency room.
Flat line equals frantic endeavor
But I guess this will have to do now.
Patrick, short flip and outside we're bringing it home.

I'm running you down.
Ooh yeah, well nothing looks right from up here.
Inside out.
I'm still unclear about the things you might have said.

I'm running you down.
Ooh yeah, well nothing looks right from up here.
Inside out.
I'm still unclear about the things you might have said.
'Bout the things you might have said.

Hold on to the things you favor most.
Shift right and let it run down.
If my peace could find a way out.
Let go of the youthful honesty
Let go of the youthful honesty
Let go of the youthful honesty

I'm running you down.
Ooh yeah, well nothing looks right from up here.
Inside out.
I'm still unclear about the things you might have said.
'Bout the things you might have said.


I'm running you down.
Ooh yeah, well nothing looks right from up here.
Inside out.
I'm still unclear about the things you might have said.
'Bout the things you might have said.


I'm running you down.
Ooh yeah, well nothing looks right from up here.
I'm still unclear.

&lt;lyrics&gt;Good morning sunshine, awake when the sun hits the sky.
Look up the sounds that surround the day you died.
She waits for me outside near a hole in the ground.
In the one way thinking you might get the upper hand.

Dear Newo Ikkin, how's Apollo been treating you?
Has he been a good boy since the day I left?
Give him my love and a sweet kiss for his head
'cause I won't be coming home, when you get this I'll be dead.

Norris and Larry, Gloria to nowhere.
Sir, I think you'd better take my hand
And Pray we'll make this one out alive.
Captain, we've lost all systems control.
Then son I'll see you in my sleep

Is it all you've shared with them that makes us paranoid?
Is it the dream that one day you might be something you're not?
Is it all you've shared with them that makes us paranoid?
Is it the dreams that make us real?
Is it the dreams that make us real?

We'll miss you and wait for you when you come.
Wrong way, right way. Bad luck, what god has been giving me.
We'll miss you and wait for you when you come.
Wrong way, right way. Bad luck, you've got to be kidding me.

I've spent so long sitting down here.
Paper cut my heart in half and discard the evidence.
When it's yours come send me the last half
Dowsed in kerosene in a torched, blazed blood bath.
When a boy sets fire, God knows you've lost at a cost that has no price.
When you've purchased guilt stand at attention
And make sure you know the lines and yourself.
Yet you'd say i'll be home, alone, again, waiting.

Wait for me alright. 
I'm still a boy down there
When you want to promise me that.
(To drive down. Where's wednesday?)

Wait for me alright. 
I'm still a boy down there
When you want to promise me that.
(To drive down. Where's wednesday?)

Wait for me alright. 
I'm still a boy down there
When you want to promise me that.
(To drive down. Where's wednesday?)&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I know that life ain't always good to you
I've seen exactly what it's put you through
Thrown you around and turned you upside down

And so you, you got to thinking there was no way out
You started sinking and it pulled you down
It may be tough, you've got to get back up

Because you know that life ain't over yet
I'm here for you so don't forget
You can count on me
'Cause I will carry you till you carry on

Anytime you need someone, somebody strong to lean on
Well, you can count on me to hold you till that healing is done
And every time you fall apart you can hide here in my arms
And you can count on me to hold you till that feeling is gone

I wonder why nobody's waiting on you
I'd love to be the one to pull you through
Your darkest times I'd love to be the light that finds you

I see the silver lining on your cloud
I'll pick you up whenever you fall down
Just take my hand and I will help you stand

Because you know that life ain't over yet
I'm here for you so don't forget
You can count on me
'Cause I will carry you till you carry on

Anytime you need someone, somebody strong to lean on
Well, you can count on me to hold you till that healing is done
And every time you fall apart you can hide here in my arms
And you can count on me to hold you till that feeling is...

Gone, so you can live today
Say so long to yesterday
Keep on counting on me to carry you till you...

Carry on
Carry on

You know that life ain't over yet
I'm here for you so don't forget
You can count on me
'Cause I will carry you till you carry on

Anytime you need someone, somebody strong to lean on
Well, you can count on me to hold you till that healing is done
And every time you fall apart you can hide here in my arms
And you can count on me to hold you till that feeling is gone

Remember life ain't over yet, I'm here for you so don't forget
That you can count on me to hold you till that feeling is gone

Remember life ain't over yet, I'm here for you so don't forget
That you can count on me to hold you till that feeling is gone&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Cold as the northern winds
In December mornings,
Cold is the cry that rings
From this far distant shore.

Winter has come too late
Too close beside me.
How can I chase away
All these fears deep inside?

I'll wait the signs to come.
I'll find a way
I will wait the time to come.
I'll find a way home.

My light shall be the moon
And my path - the ocean.
My guide the morning star
As I sail home to you.

Who then can warm my soul?
Who can quell my passion?
Out of these dreams - a boat
I will sail home to you.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;When you've gone about things all wrong bury them here
With the lifetime you would never regret.

In savoring sleep
What do you mean I toss and turn everywhere?
I'll miss you when you're gone
In pretending that you meant the world to me
With that you'd call me a liar
And in the making mistakes you'll rest incomplete.

In graver mistakes dear mom and dad,
I write you in the letter that states (I'll be home)
When the new days begun
Forget your son when he's out on his own (I'll be moving on)

When the hand reads 7:30
And your night begins to sink
In the short but faster fall.
Anxious but calm retort
To a mirror that frames your face
Baring the finest swell.
When the day begins to break
Like the tears that run across your cheek
Stand straight and imagine you then,
In the things and the way they could have been
When the thoughts, they race across your chin
Here in the Neverend.

In graver mistakes dear mom and dad,
I write you in the letter that states scratched through (I'll be home)
When the new days begun
Forget your son when he's out on his own (I'll be moving on)

Point your gun in another direction
Now that you've cried yourself to sleep.
Point your gun in another direction
Now that you've cried yourself to sleep
Here and there after the fire.

Peace, and figuring will he be home again? (before you walk home)
With wide open windows will be she waiting for? (signal loss and stereo)
With severed arm placement when the day's dark, old, and dead (the sounds surround the overpass)
We'll write her a letter with long time passing. (a dead man against you)

In graver mistakes dear mom and dad,
I write you in the letter that states (I'll be home)
When the new days begun
Forget son when he's out on his own (I'll be moving on)

Point your gun in another direction
Now that you've cried yourself to sleep.
Point your gun in another direction
Now that you've cried yourself to sleep
Here and there after the fire.

(I'll be home to say I love you,
And I'll be moving on)

And I'll be bigger
And I'll be bigger&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Hold in your last breath and stare.
Assure me your mentronome left arm stick shift
Is stuck on the right words in your ear.
Could you hear me loud and clear?
In sight and out of mind,
Cautiously avoiding the cracks
Not to disturb your steadied arm.
Straight line,
The facts before a climb,
A plan before a crime,
Tired in the days that passed away,
Sporadically arranged across your floor
When you've got it made.

Dear Mariah,
The world's not big enough for the both of us
When we live in the same town
Fight on fire, burn my hands
'till I got nothing left
To count my numbers on.

Your wide-ass comments
Could cheer you up,
The emotional disturbance.
Relax deep breath, sit back
From the space in which you stand.
Here and in demand. Don't touch
A fresh wound that bleeds
All over your carpets and stains
The story book remains,
And the page that states you've tried.
Accept and then reply,
Acknowledge the other guy,
Tired in the days that passed away,
Sporadically arranged across the floor
When you've got it made.

Dear Mariah,
The world's not big enough for the both of us
When we live in the same town
Fight on fire, burn my hands
'till I got nothing left
To count my numbers on.

Don't change your mind when all's been won.
Your words in time with the loss that you'd let 'em go
Don't let them fall if your grip's not strong
In time, decide.  With the words that you let 'em go.
Don't let them fall if your grip's not strong

Dear Mariah, come sleep in your
Dear Mariah, come sleep in your
Dear Mariah, come sleep in your
Dear Mariah, come sleep in your own

When eye meets eye, be calm
We'll lie here alone. Locked the children in the floor
When eye meets eye, be calm
We'll lie here alone. Locked the children in the floor
When eye meets eye (Your dreams can't last forever)
We'll lie here alone. Locked the children in the floor
In the floor.

Father figure wraps his face down 
We're comin' home to you.
(Your dreams can't last forever)

Locked the children in the floor
When eye meets eye (Your dreams can't last forever)
We'll lie here alone.  Locked the children in the floor.
When eye meets eye (Your dreams can't last forever)
We'll lie here alone.  Locked the children in the floor.
When eye meets eye&lt;/lyrics&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="771">While this is far from perfect, I gave Lyrikibot the ability to scrape data off multiple online services, this resulted in a HUGE amount of information, as well, a lot of dupes.  Current posting is artists with 11 or more albums that Lyrikibot knows about.  It needs some human work to polish off, but, it's definately a huge seed worth of data, with much, much, more left to post.

::Surprised someone finally looked, basically it can be used to make initial artist pages for artists that are in the list but don't have an artist page.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37558">I'd like to suggest that we move our &quot;AlbumArt&quot; naming style to one similar to our album naming scheme -- &quot;AlbumArt:Artist:Album&quot;.  Any objections?  We wouldn't have to move all the art that's already been uploaded, since their titles don't generally affect the end user. --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 15:16, 4 January 2006 (PST)

: Definately makes more sense, not sure why I didn't think of it before.  I've thought about the AlbumArt tag itself, but, it should probably remain as there may be other types of media in the future that Lyriki will support.

::Looks like images are a bit screwed up :( ... colon's aren't allowed in image names. --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 15:47, 4 January 2006 (PST)

::: Doh, maybe that's why I didn't suggest that :P can't remember if I tried it now or not, but that makes sense.  It's a small thing, and as long as most filenames follow a consistent thing, I doubt it'll be much of a problem. --[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 16:09, 4 January 2006 (PST)



What does everyone think of [[User:MindlessXD/Sandbox|this]] style of album pages? --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 19:04, 12 January 2006 (PST)

:Somehow that looks familiar, ;). I think one of the very first attempts looked very similar to that.  One of the album templates I like more is with the Artist link above, see [[Thrice:Identity Crisis (2001)]].  Perhaps lining up 'Track list' looks pretty, but, I'm fairly sure track list is obvious ;).    I'm not too sure of it myself, just so much of the text is huge, and only the name of the album is really important info.  The words 'track list' being huge seems kinda silly ;) My brain missed a step in there.   I meant to say perhaps I'd like a template that used what's currently default, (as per the thrice page) but with Tracklist lined up properly. --[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 19:43, 12 January 2006 (PST)

::Hmm?  The current artist template includes &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:monospace;&quot;&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;== Track List ==&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&quot;, but I suppose it doesn't really need to be there at all, as you said. --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 20:22, 12 January 2006 (PST)

::I removed &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:monospace;&quot;&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;== Track List ==&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&quot;, and I agree it looks better. --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 20:28, 12 January 2006 (PST)

:Yar, I've neglected putting tracklist above... well, nearly every album page I've done recently ;)  I think it might still need a little work (None of the variations are absolutely oh my gosh that's it! perfect.) :)  The biggest thing with the album page is because it features the album art it can be made mildly attractive.  I've pondered some kind of formatting for the tracks (like a tracklistbox or something, similar to how the userboxes on wikipedia are.), but, at the same time.  Lyriki's main focus is having the information available.  Presentation will constantly improve. --[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 20:32, 12 January 2006 (PST)

::After MediaWiki 1.6 is released, making a decent album template should be quite easy, however I don't know how CPU intensive such templates are -- I don't want to bog down the server. --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 20:41, 12 January 2006 (PST)

:Evelyn has more info on that, however, I'm thinking it's not exactly easy to bog down the hosting she's got.  We can see though. --[[User:24.144.33.50|24.144.33.50]] 21:00, 12 January 2006 (PST)

== General Editing Help ==

...should go [[Help:Editing|here]].  For example,
 Type this into your address bar: &quot;[http://lyriki.com/index.php?title=YourTitleHere http://lyriki.com/index.php?title=YourTitleHere]&quot;. Where it says &quot;YourTitleHere&quot; put the name of the album you want to add, in this form:
doesn't really belong here but could be incorporated into the [[Help:Editing]] page.  If the user does not know how to make a wiki page, that is where [s]he should go. --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 18:40, 19 January 2006 (PST)

 Then hit &quot;go&quot;. When you're at the album's new page you simply click the &quot;edit&quot; tab and then create the page. For first time users and for most others who want to stay uniform, it is a good idea to use one of the recommended page formats.

== various artist albums ==

Does anyone have a suggestion or even know of a rule concerning albums that have various artists? --[[User:Eric Jack Nash|Nash]] 13:43, 24 January 2006 (PST)

:I can see a few ways for handling them.  One would simply be Album Name (Year).   The one rule that would apply globally to various artists would be no artist page, obviously.  However, if we wanted to keep the naming of pages pretty standard, could use 'Various Artists' as the name of the 'artist', IE: Various Artists:Album Name (Year).  I'm leaning towards designating an artist name like 'VA' or 'Various Artists' and using that as the artist name and using the previously set standard for naming albums.   However, that might collide with some witty group that decides to use Various Artist or VA as their name.  --[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 16:15, 24 January 2006 (PST)

::I just did a search at AMG and found an electronica group called Various Artists and two artists in a sense called VA, except one is V/A and the other is V.A.  So, does that mean we should go with your first solution?  --[[User:Eric Jack Nash|Nash]] 17:05, 24 January 2006 (PST)

:::Or we could go with &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:courier;&quot;&gt;(Various Artists):Album Name (Year)&lt;/span&gt; which should avoid confusion and keep to the standards. --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 17:41, 24 January 2006 (PST)

::::I think Mindless's solution may be the best.  As I was looking at the one added without an artist name present.  I don't really like how that looks.   As for the artist listed with the song, that's easy enough, because the artist is still the person that made the song.  Link it like any other song by an artist. --[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 22:49, 24 January 2006 (PST)

I second that.  How do we make that official?  Add a section on the actual help?
--[[User:Risser|risser]] 05:53, 20 February 2006 (PST)

:Go ahead an make a section in either the album or song help pages (or both).  Also, if a song has no known artist, I think we should use &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:courier;&quot;&gt;(Unknown&amp;nbsp;Artist):Song&amp;nbsp;Name&lt;/span&gt;. --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 15:50, 20 February 2006 (PST)

::I added a section in album help for using (Various Artists) as the appropriate artist for compilations.--[[User:Risser|risser]] 07:34, 21 February 2006 (PST)

== Removing unnecessary text in piping ==

When you have a wikilink that ends in a PIPE and nothing after that pipe... it automatically removes the namespace on that link. 

So&lt;br&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;[[ARTIST:THIRD SONG'S NAME|THIRD SONG'S NAME]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;
and&lt;br&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;[[ARTIST:THIRD SONG'S NAME|]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;
produces the same output. except the second one is a bit easier.[[User:Bailey|Bailey]] 09:41, 25 January 2006 (PST)

:You bet that would be easier.  And I've been doing a copy and paste after I've typed the song name in.  So that's great that I know that now, but, just curious, what is a &quot;namespace&quot;?  --[[User:Eric Jack Nash|Nash]] 10:21, 25 January 2006 (PST)
::&quot;namespace&quot; is a programming concept which groups a whole bunch of related things together. When a wikipedia article has a colon(:) in its name the words to the left of the colon is the namespace that the article belongs to. The wiki uses the concept of namespaces to allow special things to be done for certain namespaces (an example is Template)and it also allows the system to handle requests for articles in a more efficient manner [[User:Bailey|Bailey]] 11:41, 25 January 2006 (PST)

:::I was under the impression that only the predefined namespaces are true namespaces, and therefore &quot;Metallica&quot; is not the namespace for [[Metallica:Orion]] because it is not a predefined wiki namespace, but I might be wrong... wouldn't be the first time. :P --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 14:32, 25 January 2006 (PST)

:::::I found out the hard way that leaving out what's after the | is basically a shortcut.  When the page is rendered, the wiki just puts in the information and saves that.  The problem with omitting the extra information comes when the song title contains parenthesis or the artist name contains a colon. --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 16:13, 26 January 2006 (PST)

== Year at the end of the Album? ==

I just realized the standard format calls for a year to be placed at the end of the album name. I have a couple of issues with this.
*Is this really neccesarry? You have the Artist and the Album.. most artists don't release an identically named album
*Shouldn't that be a category all by itself... as in release date? That would be much more interesting
I would like to propose moving the date to a category [[User:Bailey|Bailey]] 18:51, 25 January 2006 (PST)

::Missed that, however whats wrong with following a more standardized wiki approach of adding a qualifier though the parentheses ie &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Metallica:Master of Puppets (album)]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and adding that only when its needed? [[User:Bailey|Bailey]] 19:30, 25 January 2006 (PST)

== Extra Info in Album Link; also: DVDs ==

Hey all,
There are a few albums that have been entered that have extra info in the link, like so: [[Tool:Salival (CD/DVD/VHS boxset) (2000)]] or [[Led Zeppelin:The Song Remains The Same (Soundtrack) (1976)]].  My thoughts are, the actual title doesn't include the '''CD/DVD/VHS''' or '''Box Set''' or '''Soundtrack''' or '''Live''' in it, and it shouldn't be included in the link.  That info should be on the actual page, in the form of Notes or Album Information, but not as part of the link.  I think that clutters the links.  But before I started changing them, I wanted to see others' opinions.

Also, do DVDs belong on here?  My first thought was &quot;no&quot;, but then I thought, (a) they have songs with lyrics and (b) more and more we may see things released only on DVD, so they should probably be included.  That being said, there may be a potential for something to be released on multiple formats with different tunes.  For example, [[Talking Heads:Stop Making Sense (1984)]] was on VHS and CD, and is now on DVD and a new updated, extended CD.  I think in these instances, the format designation should probably be used to distinguish releases, but ''only'' in these instances.

Anyone? --[[User:Risser|risser]] 06:24, 20 March 2006 (PST)

:If it contains extra songs or different versions of songs that aren't on any traditional album, I think it should be included. Otherwise it's just not needed - this isn't DVDiki or whatever ;P --[[User:268229|268229]] 15:12, 20 March 2006 (PST)

I don't like the idea of included the whole CD/DVD/VHS boxset stuff in the links, no.  Cause yea, as you pointed out, it clutters up the page, and results in some lengthy article page names too. --ahoier 04:38, 3 January 2007 (PST)

== Wishlist - Script to quickly enter lyrics in an album ==

If anyone here remember the kiwizer from kiwilyrics then this would seem familiar. In any case, let me elaborate.

I'd like a way to insert the lyrics of a signle album at once, all from the same page. Theoreticaly, the page should have input boxes for Album name, Artist name, Year, Number of Tracks, and then two inputboxes for each track. The first tack inputbox would be the track name and the second the lyrics.&lt;br&gt;
When you fill in the tags a script creates the relative pages in one go. The Album Name, Artist Name, Year, Number of Tracks and the Track Names are used to create the album page and then the Artist Name, Album Name, Year and Track Name are automaticaly inserted in the SSong template while the Lyrics are inserted between the &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;lyrics&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags. Maybe have two more inputboxes to insert the album and song categorization letter if it can't be done automaticaly.&lt;br&gt;
Do you wiki-script-hackers think is doable?--[[User:Db0|Db0]] 14:50, 23 April 2006 (PDT)

:I can probably do it if it's in high demand. --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 19:06, 28 May 2006 (PDT)

== Album external links ==

Doesn't work for self-titled albums - it directs you to the artist instead of the album.
I can't think of any catch-all solution to be included in the standard album external links template, does anybody else have an idea?
If not, I'd propose a new external links template specifically for self-titled albums. --[[User:notimeless|notimeless]] 13:45, 2 December 2006 (UTC+1)
:There's no &quot;catch-all&quot; solution, not for self-titled albums nor for non self-titled albums; that's why you can specify the various links with optional parameters. [[Isobel Campbell And Mark Lanegan:Ballad Of The Broken Seas (2006)|Here]]'s an example. --[[User:Attendant|Attendant]] 18:10, 2 December 2006 (PST)

== the newish song link stuff ==

Something I'm missing, since the new song link code was added to the adding new albums.  I know it's been in a while now, but it just hit me today...Previously, when there was a song that used the pound (#) symbol, I would link to [[Artist:Number 4|#4]] for example.  But, with the new &lt;pre&gt;# {{song link|Artist|Song}}&lt;/pre&gt; stuff, I don't think this is possible anymore...or is it?  I ran into this on [[Dave Matthews Band:Crash (1996)]], where track 5 is [[Dave Matthews Band:#41]], but due to wiki/html limitations, it must be written out like [[Dave Matthews Band:Number 41]], but on the Album page, I'd like the link to that song to show up as it does on the cd cover, #44 - is there any work around? --ahoier 04:48, 3 January 2007 (PST)

:If you goto [[Dave Matthews Band:Crash (1996)]], you will notice what I've done, it doesn't have to stay that way necessary, I just think it makes the album pages look neater when the tracks appear with there proper titles and casing.  If you view the page, you'll see I just combined the old link formatting, with the newer link formatting. --ahoier 04:57, 3 January 2007 (PST)

::That's exactly what I would have suggested.  Perhaps I should add support for such things in the template. --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 08:28, 3 January 2007 (PST)

::Great!  That's awesome, looks perfect. --ahoier 04:11, 4 January 2007 (PST)


I wonder why I never think of that before? I certainly never [[Help:Standards#Capitalization|suggested that]] nor I ever implemented it in a [{{SERVER}}/index.php?title=Template:Song_link&amp;action=edit&amp;oldid=51973 template] that was recently butch-- eh... &quot;simplified&quot; ;-)

Now, seriously... I didn't started changing pages before (help pages) because I think rules defining the &quot;official&quot; way of doing things should, at least, go through some minimal discussion first, specially when they affect so many pages in a non reversible way. When we change a template without affecting the way everybody uses it, then it's no big deal, it can be easily reverted if needed, but when we tell people how to write album pages (there are almost 2000 of those) we better get it right from start or we'll end up with a mess the size of LyricWiki...

Let me say this: '''unnamed parameters suck'''. They may be convenient in some situations but they easily become a mess.

'''1st)''' They don't trim empty spaces so if someone writes '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{song link|Mark Lanegan| Museum|2:50}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' ({{song link|Mark Lanegan| Museum|2:50}}) the link will point to an unexisting page even though the page [[Mark Lanegan:Museum|exists]]. The example artificially introduces an error, however there are valid cases when this wouldn't be considered as such. For example, it's not possible to use this template like we do with other ones

{| border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
|-
| valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; |
'''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;song link'''&lt;br&gt;
'''| Mark Lanegan'''&lt;br&gt;
'''| Museum'''&lt;br&gt;
'''| 2:50'''&lt;br&gt;
'''}}'''
| valign=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; |
or like this:
| valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; |
'''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;song link'''&lt;br&gt;
'''|Mark Lanegan'''&lt;br&gt;
'''|Museum'''&lt;br&gt;
'''|2:50'''&lt;br&gt;
'''}}'''
|}
because the new line characters would still remain as part of the link.&lt;br/&gt;(''Note:'' this can be fixed by wrapping the parameters in the template with another template).

'''2nd)''' They don't scale well (actually, they don't scale at all...) when you need to add additional parameters or when you can't know in advance how many parameters the template will receive (''Note'': the original version of the template accepted various artists).

'''3rd)''' They force you to &quot;provide&quot; all unnamed parameters, even if you don't want to. To provide the &quot;'''info''' parameter&quot; you must provide the length even if it's irrelevant or unknown (you can leave it blank of course). Song links can be placed in many places, not just album pages. In some contexts it would be desirable to omit things such as the track length (think for example an artist page mentioning a single and linking to that song). Also note how since the template introduction a few days ago (a week?) already another parameter ('''disp''') had to be added: named and thus optional. If it weren't named, not only '''length''' but also '''info''' should be left blank to provide it (well... there is other way, but it's hard enough to assume it won't be used). This inconvenient only gets bigger as more parameters are needed.

I may seem as if I'm pushing it with this template, that it doesn't require so many parameters, but it's already on the edge and there's another template, [[Template:va_song_link|va song link]], with a related function (meant to be used on [[(Various Artists)|Various Artists]] records) which can't get away with using unnamed parameters. Given that it would be very convenient to use both templates the same way (since it would make things easier for users), it's also another reason not to use unnamed parameters in either template.

I'm not saying that we should adopt my [{{SERVER}}/index.php?title=Template:Song_link&amp;action=edit&amp;oldid=51973 &quot;original&quot;] version but I do think we should use it as a starting point to come out with and improved and &quot;definitive&quot; (as in &quot;one that won't change in awhile&quot;) template.

--[[User:Attendant|Attendant]] 21:30, 4 January 2007 (PST)
:I don't know much about the backend/programming stuff of templates/wiki/etc, but yea, I can understand the problem.  What was the reasoning for the change?  I actually didn't notice it until now, because tbh, I just had the templates typed up into Google Notebook, and whenever I would go to add lyrics/albums/artists, I'd copy the template, paste it into lyriki, and edit from there.  But yea, this new template/method sounds like a big can of worms. --ahoier 04:57, 5 January 2007 (PST)

:Sorry about the butchering... [[wikipedia:WP:AGF|I don't really have any excuse for that]]. :(
:Yes, the need for '''disp''' could be near completely eliminated if redirects were used. (take [[Metallica]] as an example, no '''disp''')
:The reason for unnamed parameters is to make song links shorter -- as long as the parameters are in a logical order, it should be easy for the average user to understand. If not, the template page itself provides a simple explanation.
:1) Extra spaces can easily be edited out, and I can't think of any time that we would want to make &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;song link}} multi-line.  But as you said, that's fixable.
:2) Not really sure what you mean...
:3) Not exactly true, if someone accidentally put the info in the length parameter, probably no one would notice until someone tried to add the length.  I suppose '''length''' and '''info''' could become named parameters, but this would start to defeat the purpose of the template.  '''disp''' was simply an oversight on my part (which need not be used often, as I noted above).  What other parameters would &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;song link}} need?  I can't think of an instance (aside from various artist links) which cannot be handled by &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;song link}} as it is now.
:This didn't seem to be going anyway, so I just gave it a push.  But perhaps I'm out of line again.  --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 07:51, 6 January 2007 (PST)
:[[Pink Floyd:The Dark Side of the Moon (1973)]] is what I would consider to be an ideal album.  Redirects from the every-word-capitalized titles are in place, but they are not used within the wiki. --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 09:42, 6 January 2007 (PST)

::Please, note that I was making a general case against unnamed parameters. I'm not only criticizing it's use in this template. I was pointing out things that I believe should be considered generally when dealing with templates.

::1) We agree on this. I pointed this out for 2 reasons: first, though it's possible to correct this, it's not done in the current implementation; second, though possible, it's an ugly hack that would probably result in processing overhead on the server. I really don't know how wikimedia software handles templates, so we could be dealing with a negligible overhead or a big (and unnecessary) one. The trade of between it's convenience and the overhead it brings should be considered when thinking on applying this solution.
::It's also true that currently it's unlikely to write a &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;song link}} multi-line. however, that's also dependent on the complexity of the template: if the template were to gain more parameters it may not be completely ridiculous anymore.

::2) It means that you start to realize how much unnamed parameters suck when you need to add more parameters to the template: then their &quot;logical order&quot; starts loosing sense. Same happens when there are optional parameters. Though I agree now that '''disp''' is mostly unnecessary (read at the end), same can be told about '''info''' and '''length''' or other (now inexistent) optional parameters. If &quot;logical order&quot; is already questionable with mandatory arguments, it just makes no sense when applied to optional arguments.
::You also missed the point of having both '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;song link}}''' and '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;va song link}}''' use the same parameters. Ease of use it's not the only reason for having both be used the same way. Specifying various artists separately has one ''potential'' advantage: it provides more info for the template to work with. For instance, '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;song link}}''' could use this information to build automatically (and correctly) the song artist. Say I want to make a link to &quot;John Parish And Polly Jean Harvey:Girl&quot;, if I provide to the template &quot;John Parish&quot; and &quot;Polly Jean Harvey&quot; separately (instead of only &quot;John Parish And Polly Jean Harvey&quot;) the template can be trusted to build the link with the correct (&quot;official&quot;) connector (whether it is '&amp;', 'and', 'And' or whatever).
::For the record, I also like the idea of short song links, that's why I was using mostly one letter names: '''a''' (artist, optionally followed by a number for multiple artists), '''s''' (song), '''l''' (length), '''c''' (comment -now '''info''').

::3) There's a problem with your reasoning. You're making assumptions on how people will use the template based on it's current implementation. The only reason why people wouldn't note what you point out it's because, currently (and by chance), '''length''' and '''info''' parameters are displayed exactly the same way (both with small font and between brackets, but I remember not long ago the recommended way was to have the length without brackets). A more likely outcome is that people will start using this 2 fields interchangeably (without noticing it or simply because they like the inverted order better) and it will be impossible to change those parameters' style latter without breaking existing pages. '''The implementation ''must'' be independent of the interface and vice versa'''.

::I do however rescue something from what your wrote that I think it's a really good idea (now I seriously wonder why I never think of that before :) ). Until now I was convinced that the only way of handling the capitalization/search problem was to create pages with all words capitalized, optionally creating redirects with the correct capitalization (anyone can verify that '''I've moved tons of pages''' for the sake of that...)
::It never occurred to me doing the exact opposite (which I must admit, seams a much saner approach): create the pages with the correct capitalization and then create redirects with all the words capitalized (the last part solves the search problem). Only thing needed to make this work would be a guide on how to form these correctly capitalized titles (we could even tackle the problem with capitalization in other languages). I'm all for it.
:: --[[User:Attendant|Attendant]] 15:55, 6 January 2007 (PST)

:::1) I would expect that we would create a separate template for more complex links before adding a confusing number of parameters to &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;song link}}.
:::2 &amp; 3) I see your points.  I can't think of a more graceful way to handle &quot;Various Artist&quot; links than that which you have already implemented.  However, I don't think that should have to affect the way that &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;song link}} is used (e.g. all parameters are named).  I do now agree that something should be changed regarding '''length''' and '''info'''.  Perhaps only '''info''' could become a named parameter?  That would be the most agreeable solution from my point of view. --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 22:47, 6 January 2007 (PST)

:::As far as the '''length''' and the new formatting as a whole, what was the purpose of it?  I know when I first got here, I had a little time grasphing the whole capitalization stuff, since I'm used to musicbrainz capitalization rules, but after having it explained; it all made sense to have every first letter of every word capitalized, due to wiki search methods.  But yea from what I saw, the old # [[Artist:Track...]] etc worked fine before, using '''small''' code for the time, and ''Italic text'' or whatever to note a bonus track, (equivalent to the new '''info''' parameter?), etc.  But yea, I could probably go along with the whole thing of having redirects point to the '''P'''roperly '''C'''apitalized '''T'''itle '''O'''f '''A''' '''S'''ong.  --ahoier 05:22, 7 January 2007 (PST)

::::'''@ahoier''': using templates has advantages over writing the link directly: first, it allows us to automatically change the style for all links created with it by simply changing the template code; second, it makes it easier to write them since you don't have to write the formatting yourself and you don't have to enter information repeatedly (if you do it manually you have to write the song title twice).
::::'''@MindlessXD''': I generally agree that we could create a new template if we want to add fancy stuff, but that's not what I'm talking about. When I said that '''disp''' was mostly unnecessary I didn't mean it could be taken out of the template. Changing the way we capitalize letters it's not going to help with cases such as [[Dave_Matthews_Band:Number_41|the Dave Matthews Band song that started this discussion]]. You still need a way to handle those cases where the limitation comes from the wiki itself. Now, '''disp''' does the trick for the song title but what about the artist? Is there any reason to believe this can't happen with the artist too? Obviously not. We would need to add another parameter to handle this case. Can you see where I'm going? ''You don't need to be doing unnecessarily complex things to found yourself dealing with many parameters''. The result is this: there is only 2 parameters that could be left unnamed: '''artist''' and '''title''' ('''length''' does not make the cut as it's optional).
::::Now, perhaps you can explain me why you think having to specify the artist as '''a=''' and the title as '''t=''' (that's 4 more letters) is such a big burden. Consider what you allow by having the artist be a named parameter: you can handle multiple artist separately (again, specifying multiple artist separately is better that doing it all as one!). I've already mentioned some reasons why I thinks this is a good idea (such as having the template correctly link the artists), now consider the possibility of one of the multiple artist having a # (or some other invalid character) in it's name: instead of rewriting all the artists you can just specify how to display that particular artist. An unlikely scenario, I know, but what's the cost of having this? Almost none.
::::Is this: '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;song_link|a=Mark Lanegan|t=Kingdoms of Rain}}'''
::::that much harder to write than this: '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;song_link|Mark Lanegan|Kingdoms of Rain}}'''
::::to overlook it's advantages? Or perhaps you just don't see any advantages?

:::::I feel that &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;song link|Artist|Song}} is ''simple''.  I hope you don't think I'm being irrational when I say that I'd rather see '''disp''' removed and have a separate template to handle technical restrictions than have more parameters added to &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;song link}}.
:::::I like the way the unnamed style looks.  Artist will always be the first param, song always the second, (and if length stays unnamed, like I hope it will) length will always be third.  Beyond that I don't care what order the parameters (or lack thereof) are in. --[[User:MindlessXD|MindlessXD]] 15:31, 8 January 2007 (PST)

::::::Well... you don't leave me much choice, since adding '''disp''' to another template will solve no problem at all, being that it's only function is to solve a problem with '''THIS''' template. We would need to recreate the exact same problem on another template just to have something to fix. What puzzles me is why you'd think that having an ''optional'' parameter would complicate the template: it would still be '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;song_link|artist|song|length}}''' except for those rare cases where it's technically infeasible which would became '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;song_link|artist|song|length|disp=disp}}''' (same as now). Perhaps the confusion is due to an error I made in my previous post where I mentioned the need of a disp equivalent for the artist: we won't because we don't display the artist in regular links (d'oh!). Sorry, I got mixed up thinking about '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;va_song_link}}'''...

::::::Before this discussions ends up in nothing I'd like to propose an idea that should left everybody happy. Pretty simple actually: the template would be used the same way it is used now, ''optionally'' allowing specifying multiple artist separately (this can be done easily by mapping the unnamed parameters to named ones). To make it more clear here are some use cases:

::::::*One artist, no special considerations (simpler and most common case):
:::::::&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;song_link|artist|song|length}}

::::::*One artist, invalid symbol in the song title (very rare case):
:::::::&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;song_link|artist|song|length|songdisp=songdisp}}
:::::::Changed '''disp''' to '''songdisp''' to reflect the fact that it only affects how the song title is presented.

::::::*Various artist, no other special considerations (not so rare case):
:::::::&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;song_link|a1=artist1|a2=artist|...|s=song|l=length}}
:::::::&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;song_link|artists|song|length}}
:::::::Both forms would work, the first one links artists automatically, the second one threats the multiple artists as one (the way it works now).

::::::*Various artists, invalid symbol in the song title (very rare case):
:::::::&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;song_link|a1=artist1|a2=artist|...|s=song|l=length|songdisp=songdisp}}
:::::::&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;song_link|artists|song|length|songdisp=songdisp}}

::::::::&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;song link}} and &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;va song link}} serve different purposes... You'll use &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;va song link}} when creating [[(Various Artists)]] album pages (soundtracks albums for example), where the different songs are performed by different artists (&quot;va&quot; stands for ''verbose'' artist, not for various artists as it may seem). &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;song link}} is for regular album pages where the artist is the same for all the songs so you don't need to make it explicit for each track. Which template should be used depends on the context: there'll be cases where a song is performed by more than one artist such as [[Isobel_Campbell_And_Mark_Lanegan:Revolver|Revolver]] by [[Mark Lanegan]] and [[Isobel Campbell]] but where [[Isobel Campbell And Mark Lanegan:Ballad Of The Broken Seas (2006)|you'll use &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;song link}}]] and there'll be cases where the song is performed by only one artist (such as [[Lou Reed:Perfect Day|Perfect Day]] by [[Lou Reed]]) but when on a (Various Artist) album [[(Various Artists):Trainspotting (1996)|you'll use &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;va song link}}]].

::::::::&quot;As a sidenote, you do know that templates don't ''need'' to be called with underscores, right? :P &quot;
::::::::Yeah... sorry about that. I tend to see (and write) templates as programming functions (which can't contain spaces on their names). I know templates can use spaces though, and I think is how we should use them since most people would probably prefer it that way. --[[User:Attendant|Attendant]] 19:19, 10 January 2007 (PST)

== silent tracks ==

What does everyone think about silent tracks?  Yea, they suck :P  But I figured, I'd note them on [[Korn:Follow the Leader (1998)]] - allmusic.com does not give mention of any &quot;track name&quot;...so I just left it blank, and used the info parameter to note that it's a silent track...I don't see a need to create actual track pages for these...since they couldn't really be classed under &lt;i&gt;Instrumental&lt;/i&gt; cause they are simply silent :P  On musicbrainz, they have those first 12 tracks titled as simply [Silence]...any thoughts? :) --[[User:Ahoier|ahoier]] 06:01, 20 April 2007 (PDT)</text>

&lt;lyrics&gt;So I lit lanterns to light up all these words
Looking back I know it's what I'd die for
And through all this life
Smashed away all the strife
A friendship I paint
Untouchable

Crawling from the floor
I been there before
There I was staring back at the bottom
And let's make this clear
It came from these tears
Carved across our chests
Loyalty...

And with the new light there was young hope
To underline the meaning
And carve our names in

At the end of August
The end of
At the end of August
The end of

I'll never replace the ones I first made
Jesus, does anyone?

So I lit lanterns to
Light up all these words
Looking back I know it's what I'd die for
And through all this life
Smashed away all the strife
A friendship I paint
Untouchable

And with the new light there was young hope
To underline the meaning
And carve our names in

At the end of August
The end of
At the end of August
The end of

I'll never replace the ones I first made
Jesus, does anyone?

Crawling from the floor
I been there before
And let's make this clear
Loyalty

And I want you to know
How all of you made me
How all of you saved me
And I'll never replace
The ones I first made
Jesus, does anyone?

At the end of August
The end of
At the end of August
The end of

I'll never replace the ones I first made
Jesus, does anyone?

Crawling from the floor
I been there before
There I was staring back at the floor

And let's make this clear
It came from these tears
Carved across our chests
Loyalty

Loyalty, loyal&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Just went through your eyes,
and the battle was fine.
Couldn't stand to see you screaming.
Now I realize that I might have been
part of the reason for your frowning.

And so I grey the heart and the shape,
that look that you gave, staring.
At empty help me back to awake.
And so I grey the heart and the shape.

Now the bottle plays a little factor.
Not the way I used to be, thankfully.
I was disguising a different matter,
now I engage in everything, infinity...

Help me back to awake.
There were sentences with no direction,
those are pieces that I put away.
There is sadness in the reflection,
one long look is all that it takes.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Here is your broken character, the one left of heaven.
Scissors cut him from the page, example,
continue to read not to retrace the steps, touch me.
The hemorrhaging has ceased, has ceased.

And I swallow these capsules, to regain my grip.
And I swallowed myself sick. And I inherited my health.

Here is your wake and smile, that you seem to need.
The safe and the touch, and the unweave.
Right where you placed it the night before,
Saint checks in to make sure,
you're right where you say that you are,
right where you are.

And I swallow these capsules, to regain my grip.
And I swallowed myself sick. And I inherited my health.

They all seem so truthful,
they all seem so true.
Couldn't find a better way to lie. 

And I swallow these capsules, to regain my grip.
And I swallowed myself sick. And I inherited my health.

They all seem so truthful,
they all seem so true.
Couldn't find a better way to lie.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Over mountains I feel safe,
sacred were those summers.
And these memories I place in my heart for shelter.
And I modify, just to smell the ocean.
And I underline, visualizing motion.

And I guess I miss my home,
I could not stay.
I'll return, it's alright, I'm ok.

Reoccured daydream, tie up stern first.
And these gifts I've learned, never leave me.
And I redesign, family and growing.
And I realign, forgetting nothing.

Maybe in a few years it'll come back to you,
reflection becoming your virtue.
So sort me out, lay me away.
Over these mountains I feel safe.
And bless the sound, return the day.
Over these mountains I feel safe.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Think I'll rename my heart, the calendar.
'Cause it'll surely know just when to end.
And I've been looking at you through the telephone,
as the photograph whispers that she isn't even home.
So alone, I bleed myself right in.
Unusual here breathing, inviting the silence.

But you're not here,
you're nowhere near at all.
Just skin and atmosphere.
And if it's not what you wanted,
better get out now.
Alone it takes me,
underneath it'll surely break me.
Underneath these things.

Twenty some years my parents let themselves leave.
I always swore that would never, ever be me.
And now you're looking at me through a new lens,
your voice on the end doesn't understand anything, nor do I.
Paper cuts for me.

Prove me wrong, I want you to prove me wrong.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;There were thousands of days
as we traveled down North Road,
and I remember my uncle on his last day,
and how I would kill to shake his hand again.
And on goes the battle of years upon years.
My Father's eyes bring me solace,
and his look of focus I try to instill.
As my Mother reads as an example
of strength beyond strength,
and with her I became me.
There are two girls
with whom I've known longer than anyone,
and my debt to them is Lifetime.
The gathering of boys I rely on,
know exactly who they are
and I will build their protection with bloody hands.
Some were dealt knuckles and some delivered kisses,
but initially my heart was in the right place.
There are times when being engulfed by mountains
are the only signs of safety I know.
And I realize I think this way out of neglection
and at the exact thought I reclaim those days of scenery.
There are places like the bluffs in Kasilof
and the gravel pits in Sand Lake,
that most of us will never forget.
Those are the things I wanted to speak of,
those are the things that I dream about,
those are the things that I will definitely die with,
AND THIS IS THE SONG FOR THE FISHERMAN.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;You should've called out,
made amends, broken hearts breathe unison.
I was trying to gather mine.
All my tragedies are my enemies,
all my enemies are mine.

And we carry on, just to lighten the load.

Never had I been such outsider,
eyes of the blamed,
while I was trying to reclaim.
All my tragedies are my enemies,
all my enemies are mine.

And we carry on,
just to lighten the load,
and silently we sleep with nothing underneath.

With weary hands and driven nails,
I begin to rebuild myself.
The bruises uncover the scene,
the taste of the clean.

And we carry on, outlasting,
just to lighten the load,
silently we sleep
with nothing underneath.

With your voice I keep you.
Never used like this gently.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;You couldn't hold your mouth to stop the sound,
with all these riches on the tip of your tongue,
and I was trying to dampen it all out.

You were talking louder than I should here,
producing nothing but all these mirrors,
and I was trying to play it all down.

With eyes of blood,
these kisses won't rust.
Where the baptized drown,
we used to breathe.

Underneath the red,
come running back to me.

Sad song, so wrong,
your body shakes for so long,
towing me down.
Let's just stay late,
a safe bet for second place.
This time, our time, we have, we'll last.

That evil, a brutal sickness brings,
at times you can't let go
it chases you from everything.
To settle for almost anything,
it's times like these
when you should only choose just not to speak.

And the clouds don't break when the sun is on empty.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Through the long sleep,
darkness bleeds,
through the silver and I,
reminded the layout as the wings,
they all died.
And it all hates like you,
destroys the message.

Another open eye to secrets,
with plans to scrape them clean.
And I have stacked them
higher then anyone believed.
And it downplays the scene,
it all comes crashing.

Don't be removed,
I got you where I said
that I would always put you.
And I'm heading for the bottom of you.
 
Come and take me over,
the lights have been removed,
with pieces at ankles, we answered.
And it all tastes like you,
and all it captures.

Take on me as long as you think
that you can handle,
and taking me to truth
and tearing me from scandal.
And it all saves like you,
define disaster.

And I don't die like you,
tormented skies,
treated to taste and outlast the sun.
I design what ails.

Coldest of the cold stay outside,
bring on harm's way.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;The night breathes different,
and the cold was named anew.
She sits in the wordless space.
The grin gave us away,
and that was the end,
that was everything dying,
and that was the end,
that was everything.

Cut into the face and think straight.
I was doing everything,
to keep me from choking.
With the weather heavy,
heavy at the fireside,
you'll say it so well, so well.

Dreary can come out and move yourself away.
I know you owe me, I know you owe me,
this year, this year cure me.

And I was barely here
but I'd been there for years.
Thought I'd leave it there
so it couldn't follow me here.
And I've been thinking of you
as the days grew color.
With the seconds turning hours,
my end turned alive.

The night breathes different,
and the cold was named anew.
I found so much more this way.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Press skin into skin,
just a fraction to gather the senses.
Still locking in mine, design,
just a scrape to uncover the evidence.
You won't remove me, not anymore.

So here we are, now it's obvious.
Candle lit to divide all your areas.
And inside all your barriers,
I'm defending my lines to ignite...
And I'll be this way forever.

Inside the locks hide,
so my faith can come outside and shine.
Besides it's why all these miles of road won't divide.
You won't remove me, not anymore.

And now it's where the secret's pushed behind,
with the lanterns to burn this inside.
And up there A SNOW-CAPPED ROMANCE where,
everything we build will come from our eyes...
And I'll be this way forever.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I'm not sick, I'm just a boy
Sifting through the newfound lie
And I'll be crawling through these ashes
and dissecting all these flies
Since the sun has died
and it is still somewhat July
Is this all the world has to offer?
And I don't know how much you thought I'd be
It turns to ashes on me
One more piece inside these lines
Deeper harms my disguise
And everyone is different so everyone is sly
And everything's still horrible
since everyone still dies
Is this all the world has to offer?
And I don't know how much you thought I'd be
It turns to ashes on me
Is this all the world has to offer?
It turns to ashes on me
No one is safe&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Spill it all over,
just like you used to
Reason to be strong
But you don't like me,
but you don't even know me
I will save me, I will save me
Please fight for me
Shut down in another light,
in a hole not yet sewn
Words that make you sickened inside
But you're sucked down in a steady strife
and you bleed without halo
I can tell now, I can tell now
Please fight for me
Shut down you don't know us all
Shut down you don't know us all
Shut down you don't know us all
Shut down
It's all inside, so far
It's all inside One more word,
I'm asking you to come and get it
You don't want to wake up and kiss it goodbye
Please fight for me
Shut down you don't know us all
Shut down you don't know us all
Shut down you don't know us all
Shut down
It's all inside, so far
It's all inside, so far&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Cave in and try to take away
All that I have, all I betray...
So much damage I've done
Well this I know, that I just fail
Turn me on me
Turn me on me
'Cause this is everything
I've stripped away
I've stripped away
This is me, well this I know
This is me, well is it?
Well the youth has certainly gone away
And at times I'd like to erase...
Please don't see that I can't have loyalty
'Cause I just fail Turn me on me
Turn me on me
'Cause this is everything I've stripped away
I've stripped away
And I have tried to sit you down
and take the fall
Look you in the eye and tell you it all
And I have tried to sit you down and take the fall
To look you in the eye and tell you it all...
I fail 'Cause this is everything I've stripped away
I've stripped away
This is me, well this I know
This is me I fail...
'Cause this is everything I've stripped away
I've stripped away&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Nothing new for you now, how can you bury?
Filling up all your eyes and never swearing
With your embrace I receive, receive the enemy
Is this the Christ that you need or not the Christ that you need?
Where do you gain your strength?
One look and you will know
Who chokes on boxes of fucking pills?
Choking on your thoughts of what used to be
She's clothed with the silk
Waiting to be drained dry
And the echoes will come
They'll come all around
And drain us all...dry
They'll drain us all dry
As we gag on the dust of the everyday
I choke on one more reminder you know I'm alone
Where do you gain your strength? I wish I knew...
Where do you gain your strength? I wish I knew...
She's clothed with the silk
Waiting to be drained dry
And the echoes will come
They'll come all around
And drain us all...dry
They'll drain us all dry
Faith has led the way...dismantle&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;With the absence of eye,
I can start to bleed again...
With the color of hearts it seems like you wear right thin
And as it falls from your mouth, it seems like you needed it more
Well I can still ask for more, I will still ask for more...
Get the fuck out, stay the fuck out
It makes me sick (I'm alright)

Slit wrist theory, stains us all...
Lace me up, lace me up
I'm still looking for these angels in the snow
Lace me up, lace me up
I'm still looking for these angels in the snow
It seems like a runaround
Words that won't matter
And as it falls from your mouth it seems like you
needed it more

And I will color you all red, I will color you all...red
Get the fuck out, stay the fuck out
It makes me sick (I'm alright)
Slit wrist theory, stains us all...
Lace me up, lace me up
I'm still looking for these angels in the snow
Lace me up, lace me up
I'm still looking for these angels in the snow
Braided conversation
Get the fuck out, stay the fuck out

It makes me sick (I'm alright)
Slit wrist theory, stains us all...
And caved the fuck in, and bashed the fuck in, it's so old
Slit wrist theory, stains us all...
Lace me up, lace me up
I'm still looking for these angels in the snow
Lace me up, lace me up
I'm still looking for these angels in the snow
Lace me up...&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Come brush away these fists
and I will tell you everything
I hope you know how long I'm lacking
So carve my name
and take me to the strength under it all
Then bury me where I fall

Push and pull like sex machines, like sex machines
Push and pull like sex machines, like sex machines

Questioning if I should even be here
I won't make that same mistake
And taking to bed all these things that I hate
I will complain, I will complain
A bleeding light has made us all just want to wash away
And best believe I want it blinding
Under it all I black out holes and glorify disguise
Still draining me from all this strife

Push and pull like sex machines, like sex machines
Push and pull like sex machines, like sex machines

Questioning if I should even be here
I won't make that same mistake
And taking to bed all these things that I hate
I will complain, I will complain
Stare at the sun
Staring at the sun...

Questioning if I should even be here
I won't make that same mistake
And taking to bed all these things that I hate
I will complain, I will complain...
Bury me where I fall&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I taste words you divide,
want to cover up
Temporary lies
And I see how you pressed your skin on limb
How much thicker it is,
how much thicker
Mark my words
Voice comes through the mesh, a sign of safety
Temporary smile
Cross my heart,
I'll protect my own
How much thicker it is, how much thicker
Mark my words
Dislocate yourself
And this is enough poison for me
Spilling the guilt&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Am I allowed to breathe
Am I allowed to counter
Words that don't believe
And words that don't matter
And soon I'll sigh
And forget them all
Only sometimes
Am I allowed.....breathe
And someone should have told me
That you would be here
But you weren't you anymore
You weren't you...
But you will, you will, you will, you...
Soon I will fall like the wall
And how it feels will be horror
Do you hate it?
'Cause you weren't you anymore
You weren't...
But you will, you will, you will, you...
Soon I will fall like the wall
All around fractured view of life
I tear down all these idols
And I'll make my transformation
You'll feel better.....right?
But you will, you will, you will, you...
You can't scar me...you can't
You can't scar me...you can't
How the fuck does it feel?
Soon I will fall like the wall
And how the fuck does it feel?
And how the fuck did you figure?&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Pieces of you,
spread all over,
torn in two
Forward/backward
Save yourself,
from nothing,
from no one
Forward/backward
You better get yourself out of it
You better get yourself out of it
You think you're right but it ain't right
You think it's right but it ain't right
Cease the slide, use the talent God gave you
Forward/backward
You better get yourself out of it
You better get yourself out of it
You think you're right, but it ain't right
You think it's right, but it ain't right
Forward/backward
Forward/backward&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Just when you need it
Never see it in your torn world
And seems like a plastic world
One just like you, one just like...
All I am is all I'll be
Can't be much more than me
A deep-end failing tragedy
All I am is all
I'll be Broke, believe it, deceiving
In your world
And I knew him, someone falling
One just like you, one just like...
All I am is all I'll be
Can't be much more than me
A deep-end failing tragedy
All I am is all I'll be
Take inside and be more careful
Defeat loss and glare at fall
To get you off where I'm going...
Following all down
Follow it all down
So I've got you wrapped up...inside
So I've got you...inside
And plastic world, crumbles down...
One just like you.....just like
All I am is all I'll be
Can't be much more than me
A deep-end failing tragedy
All I am
Take inside and be more careful
Defeat loss and glare at fall
To get you off where I'm going...
Following all down&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Soon I will be falling down
The way I always
And I remember falling
And I remember crawling...
Still I'm falling...
Have you come down
From all the peeling?
'Cause I remember holy
And only God can save me Still I'm falling...
This is the last time I'll speak of holding you
Take this from me and take it before it dies
'Cause this is the last time I'll speak of...holding you
Still I'm falling... This is the last time
I'll speak of holding you
And you get up and you fall down
You get up and you fall down
You get up and you fall away
You get up and you fall down
You get up and you fall down
You get up and you...you get up and you...fall&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I've got myself deep this time
Tons of frustration builds in mine
And it shows me nothing
It shows me nothing at all
Circle the drain
Backward solace right from your side
And you sit and criticize
Shows me nothing
It shows me nothing at all
Circle the drain I don't need it...
I don't It shows me nothing
It shows me nothing at all
Circle the drain I don't need it...I don't&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;A classroom circle slowly drifts on...
I knew right then I'd carve your name, so I...
Save your charity it's gone too far now
as it seems I drive by your scenery...
All the while I died that night...
Please come back, tell me it's alright
And save your charity it's gone too far now as it seems...
Little boys that misbehave
And I want to look you in your eye...
I want to look you in your eye...
Want to look you in your eye
I want to look you in your eye&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Finished with my woman
'Cause she couldn't help me with my mind
People think I'm insane
Because I am frowning all the time

All day long I think of things
But nothing seems to satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind
If I don't find something to pacify

Can you help me?
Occupy my brain?
Oh yeah!

I need someone to show me
The things in life that I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness
I must be blind

Make a joke and I will sigh
And you will laugh and I will cry
Happiness I cannot feel
And love to me is so unreal

And so as you hear these words
Telling you now of my state
I tell you to enjoy life
I wish I could but it's too late&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;We're more than carbon,
and chemicals.
We are the image of the invisible.
Free will is ours and,
We can't let go.
We are the image of the invisible.
We can't allow this,
The quiet cull.
We are the image of the invisible.
So we sing out this,
our canticle.
We are the image of the invisible.

We all were lost now we are found.
No one can stop us or slow us down.
We all are named and we are known.
We neither will never walk alone.

We're more than static,
And dial tone.
We are the image of the invisible.
We're emblematic,
Of the unknown.
We are the image of the invisible.
So raise the banner,
Bend back your bows.
We are the image of the invisible.
Remove the cancer,
take back your souls.
We are the image of the invisible.

We all were lost now we are found.
No one can stop us or slow us down.
We all are named and we are known.
We neither will never walk alone.

Though all the world may hate us,
We are named.
Though shadow overtake us,
We are known.

We're more than carbon,
and chemicals.
Free will is ours and,
We can't let go.
We are the image of the invisible.

We're more than carbon,
and chemicals.
We are the image of the invisible.
Free will is ours and,
we can't let go.
We are the image of the invisible.
We can't allow this,
The quiet cull.
We are the image of the invisible.
So we sing out this,
our canticle.
We are the image of the invisible.

We all were lost now we are found.
No one can stop us or slow us down.
We all are named and we are known.
We neither will never walk alone.
We all were lost now we are found.
No one can stop us or slow us down.
We all are named and we are known.
We neither will never walk alone.

Raise up the banner,
Bend back your bows.

Remove the cancer,
Take back your souls...&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Done...
Done...
The last real life
Beside...
Beside...
It's hard to see,
So the dotted line leaves space for you
To jump on the next ride
If luck runs out.

Blame...
Blame...
This interception
Forget...
Forget...
That it could do harm
Unless it's blow out of the water.
But I know how to help this one out,
So here comes your turn

Now I'm feeling something tonight
Feeling tonight

What...
What is the next concern?
Too perfect
Too perfect, it's a possible return
To the open wound.
But I know how to help this one out,
So here comes your turn.

Now I'm feeling something tonight
Feeling tonight
Feeling tonight
Feeling tonight
Tonight...&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;In all this time I wait for you,
I staple down my heart.
Won't somebody please undo this dream?
I'll believe you when the lights come on
And the army starts to fight the incoming.

Soon you'll be much easier to capture.
Soon you'll be much easier to capture.
So calm down any desperate thoughts I have left in me.

An acceptance missed by
Just a bit of laziness
It's only the unspeakable fear.
Something's gone
I don't know how long
It's been since it seemed this way.

Soon you'll be much easier to capture.
Soon you'll be much easier to capture.
So calm down any desperate thoughts I have left in me.

Soon you'll be much easier to capture.
Soon you'll be much easier to capture.
Soon you'll be much easier to capture.
Are you?&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Farther leads to you.
Sink and whine,
Livid cries.
I'm still in line.

Lose me
Lose me
Lose me

I cling to this.
I know it's on you,
It's around.
This time I will be calm.
See it in time.
Ss far as I know
You will be with me
As I whine.

Lose me
Lose me
Lose me&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Open up
I once was sleeping
All remains are in safe keeping
Looks like everybody knows
I want to learn the secret my way.

It's right behind me so softly.
It's right behind me so softly.
It's right...

Centered in a field;
Hold to kill,
I'm in the same rotation.
Waiting on a clear reason
Why this is the wrong way out.

It's right behind me so softly.
It's right behind me so softly.
It's right...

Lock down inside.
More of you buys my time.
I never knew this is the way it goes.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Who's amazing? You are.
You blinded the moon
And stole me the stars,
And I'm aching to give you
All I've got.
So here, don't break it
It's my only heart
And tonight was the first of many

And the days stretch out so lazy
When you're far away.
I feel that it might break me.

I knew it from the start;
This could be so hard.
What would it be if it were easy?
I knew it from the start;
This could be so hard.
What would it be if it were easy?
What would it be if it were easy?

Who's amazing? I think it's you.
I thought about it and made my move.
You smiled, you did, and blushed.
The sound of my blood rushed and rushed.
Tonight I wish that you could be here.
The farther that I fall the more
I want you near me.

And the days stretch out so lazy
When you're far away.
I feel that it might break me.

I knew it from the start;
This could be so hard.
What would it be if it were easy?
I knew it from the start;
This could be so hard.
What would it be if it were easy?

I knew it from the start;
This could be so hard.
What would it be if it was
What would it be if it was
What would it be if it were easy?

I haven't felt this good in a million years.
Shake off the dust and cobwebs; wipe away my tears.
'Cause it's everything and something more about you, yeah.
And I can't believe I lived this long without you.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I'm not sure how I feel
Inside these days.
It seems I'm slipping further
Into the black and grey.
My only way to escape,
The only way to breathe,
Is to retreat into my dreams.

I'm not sure how I feel.
I'm not certain it's real.
I don't know if you need to know.

I am the monster beneath your bed.
I am the skeleton in every closet.
All the things you hide
Down where no one will see,
Those are the things that make up me.

I thought I'd figure things out
While I was gone
Instead I realized that
I am just more alone
Don't need this disappointment,
This guessing who's to blame.
Let me go home and face my shame.

I'm not sure how I feel.
I'm not certain it's real.
I don't know if you need to know.

I can hear when you pray
But it won't make me stay,
And I think you already know.

I am the monster beneath your bed.
I am the skeleton in every closet.
All the things you hide
Down where no one will see,
Those are the things that make up me.

I'm too strong for my own good now;
I've built all these walls and I can't get out.
I'm too strong for my own good now;
I've built all these walls and I can't get out.

I'm not sure how I feel.
I'm not certain it's real.
I don't know if you need to know.

I am the monster beneath your bed.
And I am the skeleton in every closet.
All the things you hide
You know you can't hide,
Those are the things that make up me.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Sweet like a peach
With a mouth like a truck;
Little Miss Starlight
Is down on her luck.
Nothing else matters
When you're on your own.
No one else cares;
They just leave you alone.

Will I make it? Will I fall?
Will I even remember at all?
If I stumble will I cry?
Will I die?

Lost in a lie that no one believes;
No one will know 'till 
They've seen what you've seen.
I've been through the bramble,
I've been through the brush.
Came out with nothing
And nothing's not much.

Will I make it? Will I fall?
Will I even remember at all?
If I stumble will I cry?
Will I die?

Will I make it?  Will I fall?
Will I even remember?

Will I make it as I fall?
Will I even remember at all?
If I stimble as I cry
Will I die?&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Do you still remember all that you said?
I can still recall most every breath.
Never can forget the person who breaks your heart.
And now I can't let it go.
I try to bury it somewhere it can't grow.
No one ever enlightens you
Until it's too late.

And I won't give up so easy;
I can't give up the fight.
'Cause nothing ever turns out
When it's said in the middle of the night.

My situation so embarassing;
Everybody else knew everything.
Why is it always me who's the last to know?
You hid your secret so far from me
And I was so blind I could not see.
Why is love always something you push too far?

And I won't give up so easy;
I can't give up the fight.
'Cause nothing ever turns out
When it's said in the middle of the night.

And I won't give up so easy;
I can't give up the fight.
'Cause nothing ever turns out
When it's said in the middle of the night.

I try to hate you but I can't
I try to hurt you but I can't
I try to love you but I won't do that again
No, no, no, no.
I try to hate you but I can't
I try to hurt you but I can't
I try, I try, I try again.

And I won't give up so easy;
I can't give up the fight.
'Cause nothing ever turns out
When it's said in the middle of the night.

And I won't give up so easy;
I can't give up the fight.
'Cause nothing ever
Nothing ever turns out right&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;A broad incision sits across the evening.
The victim to our father's lost war,
The restless children sit and mourn the graves
Of those they've never seen before.
Will they be buried here among the dead
In the silent secret?

The pioneers;
In dealing with it they march for dawn
of will and worthy.
The truth be told, the child was born.
Man your own jackhammer.
Man your battle stations;
We'll have you dead pretty soon.
And now sincerely written from my brother's blood machine,
Man your battle stations;
We'll have you home pretty soon.
And now...

Awake through motion with curiosity to curtain your first move
Over arm's length they'll break protocol.
Jealous envy for the youngest one.
To be the hero is all I'll ask.
Can I be buried here among the dead
With room to honor me here in the end?
You'll be better off too soon;
You'll be better off when you get home.

The pioneers;
In dealing with it they march for dawn
for will and worthy.
The truth be told, the child was born.
Man your own jackhammer.
Man your battle stations;
We'll have you dead pretty soon.
And now sincerely written from my brother's blood machine,
Man your battle stations;
We'll have you home pretty soon.
And now...

For you I'd do anything
Just to make you happy, 
Hear you tell me that you're proud of me.
For them I'll kill anything;
Cut the throats of babies for them
Break their hearts for they were them.
Waiting for you to say, &quot;I love you too.&quot;

The Navigator,
The Pilot,
Her favorite;
The one they call the Vision that Bears the Gift.

The Navigator,
The Pilot,
Her favorite;
The one they call the Vision that Bears the Gift.

Will,
Do the children really understand
The things you did to them?
And why, oh why
Should they conjure up the will?
For you, my love, I would kill him.
We're coming home pretty soon.
Coming home...

In the seventh turning hour
Will the victims' shadow fall?
Should the irony grow hungry
With the victory and all they sought for?
We were one among the fence.
One among the fence...

Now we're coming home.

Man your own jackhammer.
Man your battle stations;
We'll have you dead pretty soon.
And now sincerely written from my brother's blood machine,
Man your battle stations;
We'll have you home pretty soon
'Til then...&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Listen to the world 
Out on the outside pressing in.
Are you ready on my mark?
Fingers given names
And with the last word they ascend
On the comfort of their well being in arms.
Into something they can't stop
But wish that they could kill.
You're the answer to their prayers.

In your last hour stand!
You'll notice the one that you
Had loved in dreams is here among the others.
Chase, it's you I want,
But if I can't have her
Then why should I spend any more time
In a world that's going to end pretty soon?
I need you now more than I ever did.
I'll hand myself over for you.
This comlink's lost its frequency
And I feel that we're coming home shortly.
Here take me instead,
I'd rather not see her off alone.

Scattered amongst the killing streets
The children slate defense.
Is god's work to have us fail?
Rivered blood streams out the dead
As bodies foul the air.
I'll make peace when this is done.
In arms we storm!
Slowly the streets begin to fill
With new flesh bound to bone.
Armed and ready it begins again.

In your last hour stand!
You'll notice the one that you
Had loved in dreams is here among the others.
Chase, it's you I want,
But if I can't have her
Then why should I spend any more time
In a world that's going to end pretty soon?
I need you now more than I ever did.
I'll hand myself over for you.
This comlink's lost its frequency
And I feel that we're coming home shortly.
Here take me instead,
I'd rather not see her off alone.

Tonight we storm.
Tonight...

Deliver a favor to my love.
Deliver a favor to my love.
Deliver a favor to my love.
Deliver a favor to my love.

In your last hour stand!
You'll notice the one that you
Had loved in dreams is here among the others.
Chase, it's you I want,
But if I can't have her
Then why should I spend any more time
In a world that's going to end pretty soon?
I need you now more than I ever did.
I'll hand myself over for you.
This comlink's lost its frequency
And I feel that we're coming home shortly.
Here take me instead,
I'd rather not see her off alone.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Across the floor, in the hand of where we drove the drill.
A cautious ear to the mouth of your confession.
Think of all the things we put him through;
In the face of his god would he tell the truth?

Still recorded were the words that dribbled out his kiss
When eyes go blind in this man of what could once become
Sever the limbs off his torso in sleep
And burn what remains so the world may now see.
No longer will we wait for your answers.
Back to the hell where you've come from.
Think of all the times you've once had,
Write them in a letter that says goodbye.

You'll listen to reason while you're face down in the dirt.
You'll stomach the hurt and break for him here just how much he's worth.

Slowly discarded were the remains of his lonely youth.
Among the alley where the dwellers scare to notice,
Picture a young boy in pieces and streets with leveled malfunctions,
no name to be called.
Redeemer, we'll fix him, restore him
With the love if no other.
Think of all the things you did before,
Write them in a letter that says reborn.

You'll listen to reason while you're face down in the dirt.
You'll stomach the hurt and break for him here just how much he's worth.

(Following you across the interstate) Walking away, I'll fire on
(Following you across the interstate) Walking away, I'll fire on
(Following you across the interstate) Walking away, I'll fire on

On the wrong way out
On the causeway to neverwhere.
On the wrong way out
On the causeway to neverwhere.
On the wrong way out
On the causeway to neverwhere.

Dear my friends, 
In the time we've spent
Forever after beyond this, when will our nightmare ever end?
Dear my friends, 
In the time we've spent
Forever after beyond this, when will our nightmare ever end?

Pull the trigger and the nightmare stops.
Pull the trigger and the nightmare stops.
Pull the trigger and the nightmare stops.
Forever you will,
Forever you will learn.

Pull the trigger and the nightmare stops.
Pull the trigger and the nightmare stops.
Pull the trigger and the nightmare stops.
Forever you will,
Forever you will learn.

Pull the trigger and the nightmare stops.
Pull the trigger and the nightmare stops.
Pull the trigger and the nightmare stops.
Forever you will,
Forever you will learn.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Is this everything?
I've dreamed of so much more
Between the end and where we lie.
Here all our hopes and dreams are scavenged from the floor
And fed into machines that feed on vacant eyes.
All of my dreams always find me
Far beyond these fake fluorescent skies.
I know there must be something more;
If I could only find the door
Then I could free myself and see the world outside.

Where daylight breaks on you and shines into the
Grey that sleeps beneath your skull.
Daylight breaks on you and burns away the
Grey that suffocates your soul.

For now I hold a key,
And though I may be lost
I know that I will find my way.
I search endlessly but every time
I've thought that I was near
The smoke and mirrors lead me astray.
See the pit-boss, steal each tick-tock;
Time it seems will suffer at our hands.
Look for exits in the haze,
The dense electric twilight maze.
I've heard that there is one that leads to sun-lit lands.

Where daylight breaks on you and shines into the
Grey that sleeps beneath your skull.
Daylight breaks on you and burns away the
Grey that suffocates your soul.

(daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight)

Daylight: They tell me that it's just a myth
And they try to betray me with a kiss.
And daylight: they tell me that it can't exist
And they might never know just what they missed is

Daylight pours fire into my grey eyes,
Pours grace into my grey life,
Breaks in and lights the way.
I can't live without the day.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Throw your dollar bills and leave your thrills all here with me
And speak but don't pretend I won't defend you any more you see
It aches in every bone I'll die alone but not for you 
My eyes won't need to see that ugly thing I know it's me you fear

If you want me hold me back

Frail the skin is dry and pale
The pain will never fail
And so we go back to the remedy
Clip the wings that get you high
Just leave them where they lie
And tell yourself you'll be the death of me

I don't need a friend I need to mend so far away
So come sit by the fire and play a while but you can't stay too long
It aches in every bone I'll die alone but not for pleasure
I see my heart explode it's been eroded by the weather here

If you want me hold me back

Frail the skin is dry and pale
The pain will never fail
And so we go back to the remedy
Clip the wings that get you high
Just leave them where they lie
And tell yourself you'll be the death of me

Frail the skin is dry and pale
The pain will never fail
And so we go back to the remedy
Clip the wings that get you high
Just leave them where they lie
And tell yourself you'll be the death of me

Hold your eyes closed take me in
Hold your eyes closed take me in

Yeah

Frail the skin is dry and pale
The pain will never fail
And so we go back to the remedy
Clip the wings that get you high
Just leave them where they lie
And tell yourself you'll be the death of me

Frail the skin is dry and pale
The pain will never fail
And so we go back to the remedy
Clip the wings that get you high
Just leave them where they lie
And tell yourself you'll be the death of me&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;If I gave you the truth would it keep you alive
Though I'm closer to wrong I'm no further from right
And now I'm convinced on the inside something's wrong with me
Convinced on the inside there's so much more than me

Yeah

No there's nothing you say that can salvage the lie
But I'm trying to keep my intentions disguised
And now I'm deprived of my conscience and something's got to give
Deprived of my conscience this all belongs to me

Yeah

I'm beaten down again I belong to them
Beaten down again I've failed you
I'm weaker now my friend I belong to them
Beaten down again I've failed you

The deception you show is your own parasite
Just a word of advice you can heed if you like
And now I'm convinced on the inside something's wrong with me
Convinced on the inside you're so much more than me

Yeah

I'm beaten down again I belong to them
Beaten down again I've failed you
I'm weaker now my friend I belong to them
Beaten down again I've failed you

I'm beaten down again I belong to them
Beaten down again I've failed you
I'm weaker now my friend I belong to them
Beaten down again I've failed you

I'm beaten down
I'm beaten down
I'm beaten down
I'm beaten down

Yeah&lt;/lyrics&gt;

----

&lt;lyrics&gt;
Heaven ablaze in our eyes
We're standing still in time
The blood on our hands is the wine
We offer as sacrifice

Come on and show them your love
Rip out the wings of a butterfly for your soul my love
Rip out the wings of a butterfly for your soul

This endless mercy mile
We're crawling side by side
With hell freezing over in our eyes
Gods kneel before our crime

Come on and show them your love
Rip out the wings of a butterfly for your soul my love
Rip out the wings of a butterfly for your soul

Rip out the wings of a butterfly don't let go
Rip out the wings of a butterfly for your soul

Come on and show them your love
Rip out the wings of a butterfly for your soul my love
Rip out the wings of a butterfly for your soul

Rip out the wings of a butterfly don't let go (my love)
Rip out the wings of a butterfly for your soul

Rip out the wings of a butterfly don't let go (my love)
Rip out the wings of a butterfly for your soul

&lt;lyrics&gt;(Feat. Adam Levine of Maroon 5)

Mr. West [echoes]

[Kanye West]

Uh, Yeah, Uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh, yeah

[Piano drops]

And I heard 'em say, nothin ever promised tommorow today
From the Chi, like Tim its the Hard-a-way
So this is in the name of love, like? Raba? say
Before you ask me to get a job today, can I atleast get a raise on a minimum wage?
And I know the gouverment administered AIDS
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
Allah o Akbar and throw em some hot cars
Things we see on the screen are not ours
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far
Where im from, the dope boys is the rock stars
But they can't cop cars without seein' cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars
I know it

[Chorus (Adam Levine)]
Uh, And I heard 'em say, nothin ever promised tommorow today
(Ooooooooo)
And I heard 'em say, nothin ever promised tommorow today
(Nothing's ever promised tommorow today.)
But we'll find a way
(And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it helps but it may be the only way)

[Kanye]
They say people in your life are seasons
And anything that happen is for a reason
And niggas guns a clappin and keep to squeezin'
And Gran (Grandma) keep prayin' and keep believin'
And Jesus and one day that ya see him
Till they walk in his footsteps and try to be him
The devil is alive I feel him breathin'
Claimin' money is the key so keep on dreamin'
And put those lottery tickets just to tease us
My aunt Pam can't put those cigarettes down
Now my lil cousin smokin those cigarettes now
His job trying to claim that he too niggerish now
Is it cuz his skin blacker than licorice now?
I can't figure it out...
Im Stickin around...

[Chorus (Adam Levine)]
Uh, And I heard 'em say, nothin ever promised tommorow today
(Ooooooooo)
And I heard 'em say, nothin ever promised tommorow today
(Nothing's ever promised tommorow today.)
But we'll find a way
(And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it helps but it may be the only way)

(Cuz every words we swore we got more far away, and nothing's ever promised tommorow today
And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it helps but it may be the only way)

[Beat Changes]&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;[Intro/Chorus One: Kanye West]
I gotta testify
I'm up in the spot lookin extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky
Gotta testify
I'm up in the spot lookin extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky

[Kanye West]
Back when they thought pink Polos would hurt the Roc
Before Cam got the shit to pop
The doors was closed, I felt like Bad Boy's street team
I couldn't work the locks/The LOX
Now let's go, take 'em back to the plan
Me and my momma hopped in that U-Haul van
Any pessimists I ain't talk to them
Plus I ain't have no phone in my apart-a-ment
... Let's take 'em back to the club
Least about an hour I stand on line
I just wanted to dance, I went to Jaboc an hour
after I got my advance, I just wanted to shine
Jay favorite line, dawg in due time
Now he look at me like damn dawg, you what I am
A hip-hop legend, I think I died
in an accident, cause this must be heaven

[Chorus One]

[Chorus Two 2X: Kanye]
Now let's take them hi-ah-igh-igh-igh-ighhhh (Top of the world baby)
(Top top of the world)
A-la-la-la-lah-la-lahhhhh (Top of the world baby)
(On top of the world)

[Kanye West]
Back when Gucci was the shit to rock
Back when Slick Rick got the shit to pop
I'd do anything to say I got it
Damn, them new loafers hurt my pocket
Before anybody wanted K-West beats
Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC
Dog, I was having nervous breakdowns
Like &quot;Man - these niggaz that much better than me?&quot;
Baby, I'm goin on an airplane
And I don't know if I'll be back again
Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets
But when she came to kick it, things became different
Any girl I cheated on, sheets I skeeted on
Culdn't keep it home, thought I needed a Nia Long
I'm tryin to right my wrongs
But it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song, now

[Chorus Three]
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky
You gon' touch the sky baby girl, testify
Come up in the spot lookin extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky

[Lupe Fiasco]
Yes, yes, yes, guess who's on third
Lupe steal like Lupin the 3rd
Here like air 'til I'm beer on the curb
Peachfuzz buzz but bid on the verge
Let's slow it down like we're on the syrup
Bottle shaped body like Mrs. Butterworth
But, before you say another word
I'm back on the block like I'm layin on the street
I'm tryin to stop lion/lyin like I'm Mum-Ra
But I'm not lyin when I'm layin on the beat
En garde, or touche', Lupe cool as the under
But I still feel posessed as a gun charge
to come/cum as correct as a porn star
And a fresh pair steps in my best foreign car
Self, I represent the first
Now let me end my verse right where the horns are

[Chorus Three]

We take it home baby
Sky high, I'm, I'm sky high
I'm, I'm sky high
I'm, I'm sky high
I'm, I'm sky high
I'm, I'm sky high
Sky, uh, sky high
I'm, I'm sky high
Yeah, keep it rollin, yeah
Feels good to be home baby, feels good to be home&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;[Jamie Foxx]
She take my money when I'm in need
Yea she's a triffling friend indeed
Oh she's a gold digger way over town
That dig's on me

[Chorus]
(She did me wrong)
Now I ain't saying she a gold digger (When I'm Need)
But she ain't messing with no broke niggaz
(She did me wrong)
Now I ain't saying she a gold digger (When I'm need)
but she ain't messing with no broke niggaz
get down girl gone head get down (I gotta leave)
get down girl gone head get down (I gotta leave)
get down girl gone head get down (I gotta leave)
get down girl gone head

[Verse 1]
Cutie the bomb
Met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton
Under her underarm
She said I can tell you ROC
I can tell by ya charm
Far as girls you got a flock
I can tell by ya charm and ya arm
but I'm looking for the one
have you seen her
My psychic told me she'll have a ass like Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids
An I gotta take all they bad ass to show-biz
Ok get ya kids but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in
We all went to Den and then I had to pay
If you fucking with this girl then you better be payed
You know why
It take too much to touch her
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
My best friend say she use to fuck with Usher
I dont care what none of y'all say I still love her

[Chorus]
(She did me wrong)
Now I ain't saying she a gold digger (When I'm Need)
But she ain't messing with no broke niggaz
(She did me wrong)
Now I ain't saying she a gold digger (When I'm need)
but she ain't messing with no broke niggaz
get down girl gone head get down (I gotta leave)
get down girl gone head get down (I gotta leave)
get down girl gone head get down (I gotta leave)
get down girl gone head

[Verse 2]
18 years, 18 years
She got one of yo kids got you for 18 years
I know somebody paying child support for one of his kids
His baby momma's car and crib is bigger than his
You will see him on TV Any Given Sunday
Win the Superbowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was spose to buy ya shorty TYCO with ya money
She went to the doctor got lypo with ya money
She walking around looking like Micheal with ya money
Should of got that insured got GEICO for ya moneeey,(money, money)
If you ain't no punk holla We Want Prenup
WE WANT PRENUP!, Yeaah
It's something that you need to have
Cause when she leave yo ass she gone leave with half
18 years, 18 years
And on her 18th birthday he found out it wasn't his

[Chorus]
(She did me wrong)
Now I ain't saying she a gold digger (When I'm Need)
But she ain't messing with no broke niggaz
(She did me wrong)
Now I ain't saying she a gold digger (When I'm need)
but she ain't messing with no broke niggaz
get down girl gone head get down (I gotta leave)
get down girl gone head get down (I gotta leave)
get down girl gone head get down (I gotta leave)
get down girl gone head

[Verse 3]
Now I ain't saying you a gold digger you got needs
You dont want ya dude to smoke but he can't buy weed
You go out to eat and he cant pay y'all cant leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves
But why y'all washing watch him
He gone make it into a Benz out of that Datson
He got that ambition baby look in his eyes
This week he mopping floors next week it's the fries
So, stick by his side
I know his dude's balling but yea that's nice
And they gone keep calling and trying
But you stay right girl
But when you get on he leave yo ass for a white girl

get down girl gone head get down (I gotta leave)
get down girl gone head get down (I gotta leave)
get down girl gone head get down (I gotta leave)
get down girl gone head

(can you play that back)&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;(Vocal ad-libs)

[Chorus]
Drive slow, homie..
Drive slow, homie..
You never know, homie
Might meet some hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My homie Mali used to stay, 79th and May
One of my best friends from back in the day
Down the street from Calumet, a school full of stones
He nicknamed me K-Rock so they'll leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
And walked around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand, keys in his hand
Reason again to let you know he's the man
Back when we rocked the 'Leases, he had dreams of Caprices
Drove by the teachers, even more by polices
How he get the cash the day his father passed away
Left him with a lil somethin, 16 he was stuntin
&quot;Al B. Sure!&quot; nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit Lakeshore, girls go all crazy
Hit the freeway, go at least bout 80
Boned so much that summer, even had him a baby
See back back then then if you had a car
You was the Chi-Town version of Baby
And I was just a virgin, a baby
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked
We'll take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had they Lakers and Aurora's, we was hurtin 'em all
With the girls alot of flirtin involved, dog..
Fuck all that flirtin, I'm tryin to get in some drawers, so
Put me on with these hoes homie
He told me, &quot;Don't rush to get grown, drive slow homie&quot;

[Chorus]
Drive slow, homie
	(Drive slow...)
You never know, homie
About these hoes homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie

[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
What it do
I'm posted up in the parking lot, my trunk wavin
The candy gloss is immaculate, its simply amazing
Them elbows pokin wide on that candy 'Lac
Trunk open, screens on, neon's lit with 5th relaxed
I'm on a mission for dime pieces and sexy ladies
Allow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes
It's a star-studded event when I valet park
Open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark
You see them 4's crawlin, you see them screens fallin
The disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin
I'm leanin on the switch, sittin crooked in my slab
But I could still catches boppers if I drove a cab
A young Houston hard-hitter all about the scrilla
Ridin' somethin candy-coated crawlin like a caterpillar
I'm tippin on them 4's, I'm jammin on that Screw
I'm lookin for them hoes baby, what it do

[Chorus: Kanye West &amp; (GLC)]
Drive slow, homie
	(Turn your hazard lights on when you see them hoes...)
Drive slow, homie
	(If you ridin around the city with nowhere to go...)
Drive slow, homie
	(Live today, cause tomorrow man, you never know...)
You never know, homie
Might meet some hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie

[Verse 3: Kanye West &amp; GLC]
(Kanye West)
My car's like the movie, my car's like the crib
I got mo TV's in here than where I live
(GLC)
And that don't make no sense, but baby I'm the shit
And everything I flip, you know it's somethin serious
I got the custom grill, I got the Bravis rims
I got the baller genetics baby this evidence
You see a player flickin, and how you ain't convinced
That you should go on and kiss it, &quot;just a lil bit&quot; *echoes*
I wearin my custom kicks, I got my Jesus chain
My canary's is gleamin, through my angel wings
They see me, hoes actin like they seen a king
With that mean lean, smokin on that finest Cali green
My woodgrain oak, I'm ridin on Vogues
My cylinder quiet, like tip-toes
I sold O's, and this I know
When you see them hoes, lil homie drive slow *echoes*

(John Legend harmony ad-libs)

*song starts from beginning, this time screwed*

Yea
Drive slow, homie..
Drive slow, homie..
You never know, homie
Might meet some hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie

Drive slow, homie&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;* samples are from &quot;Home is Where the Hatred Is&quot; by Gil Scott-Heron

[Common]
Yeah
{* &quot;I'm on my way home&quot; - sample repeats throughout}
They say home is where the hate is, my dome is where fate is
I stroll where souls get lose like Vegas
Seen through the eyes of rebel glasses
Pray to God that my arms reach the masses
The young smoke grass in grassless jungles
Rubber band together in cashless bundles
We wear strugglin chains, divided only hustle remains
Makin sense of it we hustle for change
Revolution ain't a game it's another name, for life fightin
Someone to stay in they corner like Mike Tyson
Heights fightin for hits to heighten they hell
Don't he know he could only get as high as he fell
Show money becomes bail, relationships become jail
Children are unhailed
I wish love was for sale, &quot;Behold the Pale - Horse&quot;
got me trapped like R. Kel', I bail and it

{* &quot;Might not be such a bad idea if I never... never went home again&quot;}
{* &quot;I'm on my way home&quot;} {&quot;I left three days ago, but no one seems to know I'm gone&quot;}
{* &quot;Home is where the hatred is; home is filled with pain and it&quot;}
{* &quot;Might not be such a bad idea if I never... never went home again&quot;}&lt;/lyrics&gt;

That's that crack music nigga
That real black music nigga
  {La la la la la la la lahhhh, la la la la la lahhhh}
(That's that crack music nigga)
(That real black music nigga)
  {La la la la la la la lahhhh, la la la la la lahhhh}

[Kanye West]
How we stop the Black Panthers?
Ronald Reagan cooked up an answer
You hear that?  What Gil Scott is &quot;Heron&quot;
When our heroes or heroines got hooked on heroin
Crack, raised the murder rate in D.C. and Maryland
We, invested in that, it's like we got Merrill Lynched
And we been hangin from the same tree, ever since
Sometimes I feel the music is the only medicine
So we, cook it, cut it, measure it, bag it
Sell it, the fiends, cop it, nowadays they can't tell if
that's that good shit, we ain't sure man
Put the CD on your tongue, yeah that's pure man

[Chorus]

[Kanye West]
From the place where the father's gone, the mothers is hardly home
And the madigon's lock us up in the Audy Home
How the Mexicans say, we just tryin to party homes
They wanna pack us all in a box like styrofoam
Who gave Saddam anthrax?
George Bush got the answers
Back in the hood it's a different type of chemical
Arm &amp; Hammer baking soda raised they own quota
Right when our soldiers, ran for the stove cause
Cause, dreams of being Hova
Went from bein a broke man to bein a dopeman
to bein the President, look there's hope man
This that inspiration for the Moes and the folks man
Shorty come and see his momma straight overdosin
... And this is the soundtrack
This the type of music that you make when you 'round that

[Chorus]

[Kanye West]
God, how could you let this happen {*echoes*}

[harmonizing for 18 seconds]

[Kanye West]
Uhh, that's that crack music, crack music
That real black music, black music
  {La la la la la la la lahhhh, la la la la la lahhhh}

[The Game]
That's that crack music nigga
That real black music nigga
  {La la la la la la la lahhhh, la la la la la lahhhh}

  {La la la la la la la lahhhh, la la la la la lahhhh}
  {La la la la la la la lahhhh, la la la la la lahhhh}

[Kanye West]
Uhh, that's that crack music, crack music
That real black music, black music
  {La la la la la la la lahhhh, la la la la la lahhhh}
Our father, give us this day, our daily bread
Before the feds give us these days and take our daily bread
See I done did all this ol' bullshit
And to atone, I throw a lil' somethin somethin on the pulpit
We took that shit, measured it and then cooked that shit
And what we gave back, was crack, music
And now we ooze it, through they nooks and crannies
So our mommas ain't got to be they, cooks and nannies
And we gon' repo everything they ever took from grammy
Now the former slaves trade hooks, for Grammy's
This dark diction, has become America's addiction
Those who ain't even black use it
We gon' keep baggin up this here, crack music&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;[Kanye West]
I know it's past visiting hours
But can I please give her these flowers?
The doctor don't wanna take procedures
He claim her heart can't take the anaesthesia
It'll send her body into a seizure
That lil' thing by the hospital bed, it'll stop beepin
Hey chick, I'm at a loss for words
What do you say at this time?  Remember when I was 9?
Tell her everything gon' be fine, but I be lyin
Her family cryin, they want her to live, and she tryin
I'm arguin like what kind of doctor can we fly in
You know the best medicine go to people that's paid
If Magic Johnson got a cure for AIDS
And all the broke muh'fuckers passed away
You tellin me if my grandma's in the NBA
Right now she'd be okay?  But since she
was just a secretary, worked for the church for 35 years
Things 'sposed to stop right here
My grandfather tryin to pull it together, he strong
That's where I get my confidence from
I asked the nurse did you do the research?
She asked me can you sign some t-shirts?
Bitch, is you smokin reefer?
You don't see that we hurt?  But still

[Chorus]
I, smiiile, when roses come to see me
And I, can't wait for a sunny day (seeing it through your eyes)
Can't wait for the clouds to break

[Kanye West]
They outside of the emergency room
You can feel my heartbeat, beat, beat
If she gon' pull through, we gon' find out soon
But right now she sleep, sleep, sleep
My momma say they say she could pass away any day
Hey chick, what these doctors know anyway?
Let me see the X-rays, I ain't no expert, I'm just hurt
Cousin Kim took off of work
Plus my Aunt Shirley, Aunt Beverly, Aunt Clay and Aunt Jean
So many Aunties we could have an Auntie Team
Feel like Amerie, it's just &quot;One Thing&quot;
When they said that she made you see they eyes gleam
I think we at a all-time high
To get there, we run, we fly, we drive
Cause with my family we know we're home
And so instead of sendin flowers, we the roses

[Chorus]

[sung] It brings the sunshine, oooooooooooh

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[sung]
I, smiiile, when Rosey come to see me
And I'm saaaad, when Rosey goes away
Ohhhhhhhhhh Rosey brings the sunshine (sayyyyy)

Can't wait, I can't wait, no
Can't wait, I can't wait, no
Can't wait, I, can't wait
No, can't wait, for, for a sunny day
Momma can't wait, for the clouds to break
Mm mmm mm mm-mm mm-mm
Ohhhh ohhh ohh ohh no noooo, say
Tellin you the truth now
Said I can't wait, uh-uh
I won't wait, no&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;[Chorus: Brandy]
I always knew that one day
They'd try to bring me down
WOoow, one day, they tried to bring me down
ALways knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down
Dooown, way down

[Kanye]
We goin' to mass today, we have to pray
Besides what the pastor say, I have to say
Since Pac passed away
Most you rappers don't even deserve a track from me
You see, if you evern wanted to ever be anything
There'd always be somebody that shoot down any dream
There'll always be haters, that's the way it is
Hater niggaz marry hater bitches and have hater kids
But they gon' have to take my life 'fore they take my drive
'Cause when I was barely livin, that's what kept me alive
Just the thought that maybe it could be better than what we at at this time
Make it out of this grind, 'fore I'm out of my mind
And get some  lee way on the he say she say
You girl don't like me, how long has she been gay
Spanish girls say &quot;No able ingle&quot;
And everybody want to run to me for their SINGLE
It's funny how these wack niggaz need my help
Wasn't around when I couldn't feed myself
Dog, If I was you, I wouldn't feel myself
Dog, If I was you, I'd kill myself
Made a mill myself, and I'm still myself
And I'ma look in the mirror if I need some help
Ask me from the heart, y'all all frontin
Everybody feel a way about K but at least y'all feel somethin

[Brandy]
Why you come here, I bet it only it was forget to get ya
What kind of dream we found, see I'm often at your cross way
forgetting it was that heaven let ya. They tried to bring me down

[Chorus] - 5X&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;[sung]
You make me smiiiiiiile with my heart, ohh

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Why everything that's 'sposed to be bad, make me feel so good?
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would
Man I tried to stop man, I tried the best I could, but
(You make me smiiiiiiile)

[Kanye West]
What's your addiction?  Is it money?  Is it girls?  Is it weed?
I've been afflicted, by not one, not two, but all three
She's got the same thing, about me, but more, about us
And she's comin over, so I guess, that means, I'm her drugs
Just let me peak now, I mean dang, I'm so, curious
She's got a lover, so the lies, and the lust, is a rush
Time's of the essence, I need you, to be spon-taneous
Roll up the doja, Henny and C-Ca-Coca-Cola
Then I'm c-comin over, cause it's n-never over

[Chorus]

[Kanye West]
I see the emotion, in your eyes, that you tried, not to show
We get the closest, when you high, or you drunk, or you blowed
So I pour the potion, so we can both, get high, as we can go
Then I'll get the lotion, it do somethin to me, when your thighs, is exposed
There's no turnin back now, I mean I, don't mean, to impose
Not now but right now, I need you, to undress, and then pose
I'm into that now, catch a vibe, when the doors, get closed
Roll up the doja, Henny and C-Ca-Coca-Cola
And I keep com-comin over, cause it's n-never over, uhh

[Chorus] 

[Strings]
Why everything that's 'sposed to be bad, make me feel so good?
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would
Man I tried to stop man, I tried the best I could, but
(You make me smiiiiiiile)

(You make me smiiiiiiile with my heart, ohh)

[Chorus]

[Kanye West]
I, just wanted to ask you
Just wanted to umm, let me how would I put this umm
Let's say, of your friends
Remember the one, huh?
You said, if you ever she would be the one
Okay, okay, okay, well, I was thinkin
Hypothetically, I mean don't take this seriously
Don't take me, I mean just, umm, not credibly
I, feel it incredibly
I mean let's let it be, I, just let it be
I mean you her and me, I mean you her and me
Baby?  Baby?  Baby?
Baby?  Baby?
You know I was just kiddin
Unless you gon' do it
(You make me smiiiiiiile)&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;[Intro: Shirley Bassey sample]
Diamonds are forever
They are all I need to please me
They can't stimulate or tease me
They won't leave in the night
Have no fear that they might desert me

[Hook: Kanye West] + (sample)
(Diamonds are forever, forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
(Diamonds are forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive everytime I rhyme
(Forever...)
Forever ever? Forever ever?
Ever ever? Ever ever?
Ever ever? Ever ever? Ever ever?

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Good morning, this ain't Vietnam still
People lose hands, legs, arms, fo' real
Little was known on Sierra Leone
And how it connect to the diamonds we own
When I spit the diamonds in this song
I ain't talkin' 'bout the ones that be glowin'
I'm talkin' 'bout Roc-a-Fella, my home
My chain, this ain't conflict diamonds
Is they Jacob? Don't lie to me, man
See, a part of me sayin', &quot;Keep shinin'&quot;
How? When I know what a blood diamond 's
Though it's thousands of miles away
Sierra Leone connect to what we go through today
Over here it's a drug trade, we die from drugs
Over there they die from what we buy from drugs
The diamonds, the chains, the bracelets, the charmses
I thought my Jesus piece was so harmless
'Til I seen a picture of a shorty armless
And here's the conflict
It's in a black person soul to rock that gold
Spend your while life tryin' to get that ice
On a Polo rugby it look so nice
How can something so wrong make me feel so right?
Right? 'fore I beat myself up like Ike
You can still throw your Roc-a-Fella diamond tonight
Because

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
People askin' me is am I gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question dog, &quot;Yo where Dame at?&quot;
This track the Indian dance that bring our reign/rain back
What's up with you and Jay, man?
Are y'all okay man?

[Jay-Z]
Yup, I got it from here 'Ye, damn
The chain remains, the game is intact
The name is mine, I'll take blame for that
The pressure's on but guess who ain't gon' crack
Haha, pardon me, I had to laugh at that
How could you falter when you're the Rock of Gibraltar?
I had to get off the boat so I could walk on water
This ain't no tall order, this is nothin' to me
Difficult takes a day, impossible takes a week
I do this in my sleep
I sold kilos of coke, I'm guessin' I can sell CDs
I'm not a businessman
I'm a business, man
Let me handle my business, damn
Kanyeez you got me, Freeway then Foxy
YG's, Tiar', 'merie, Peedi watch me
Bleek could be one hit away his whole career
As long as I'm alive he's a millionaire
And even if I die he's in my will somewhere
So he could just kick back and chill somewhere
Oh yeah, he don't even hafta write rhymes
The Dynasty like my money, last three lifetimes
Shirley Bassey's in the red sayin' exactly
What I been sayin' practically my whole career
A diamond is forever, I been minin' this forever
Now the Louis Vuitton Don's timin' couldn't be better
People lined up to see the Titanic sinkin'
Instead we rose up from the ash like a phoenix
If you waitin' for the end, the Dynasty sign
And what seem like forever is a mighty long time

[Outro: Jay-Z] + (sample)
(Forever...)
Uh, Young, bitches
Haha
Goodnight!&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;[Chorus: Really Doe]
You muh'fuckers better do your job and roll up, and WATCH how we roll up
An', I can't control it cain't hold it, it's so NUUUUUUTS
I take a sip of that 'gnac, I wanna FUUUUUCK
I take a hit of that chronic, it got me stuck
But really what's amazin is how I keep blazin
Towel under the door, we smoke until the day's end
Puff puff and pass, don't fuck up rotation
Hypnotiq or Henny?  Nah nigga, that's a chaser
Turn nuttin to somethin, now pimpin that's a savior
Best things like green now pimpin get your paper
High off the ground from stair to skyscraper
Cool off, thinkin we local c'mon homey we major

[Kanye West]
We major?  C'mon homey we major
We MAJOR?!  C'mon homey we major
We major, c'mon homey we major
We major, c'mon..

Feelin better than some head on a Sunday afternoon
Better than a chick that say yes too soon
Until you have a daughter that's what I call karma
And you pray to God she don't grow breasts too soon
Projects to' up, gang signs is thrown up
Niggaz hats broke off, that's how we grow up
Why else you think shorties write rhymes just to blow up?
Get they first car and then IRS show up
He ain't never had shit, but he had that 9
Nigga come through flickin and he had that shine
Put 2 and 2 together and a little bad weather
Gon' be your whole family on that funeral line
Asked the reverend was the strip clubs cool
If my tips helped send a pretty girl through school
That's all I want, like winos want they good whiskey
I ain't in the Klan but I brought my hood with me

[Chorus]

[Nas]
We major?  C'mon homey we major
We major?  C'mon homey we major
We major!  C'mon homey we major
We major!  C'mon homey we major

I heard the beat and I ain't know what to write
First line should it be about the hoes or the ice?
Fo-fo's or Black Christ?  Both flows'd be nice
Rap about big paper or the black man plight
At the studio console, asked my man to the right
What this verse sound like, should I freestyle or write?
He said, &quot;Nas what the fans want is Illmatic still&quot;
Looked at the pad and pen, fell, and jotted what I feel
Been like twelve years since a nigga first signed
Now I'm a free agent and I'm thinkin it's time
to build my very own Motown
Cause rappers be deprived, of executive 9 to 5's
And it hurts to see these companies be stealin the life
And I love to give my blood sweat and tears to the mic
So y'all copped the LP's and y'all fiends got dealt
I'm Jesse Jackson on the balcony when King got killed
I survived the livest niggaz around
Last longer than more than half of you clowns
Look, I used to cook before I had the game took
Either way my change came like Sam Cooke

Yeah!  Yeah!  Ye-yeah, ye-yeah

[Tony Williams]
Feeling better than I ever felt before today
But better late than never, it's
Orien-tation, still we can make it better
Throwin all your cares away...

[Chorus]

[Kanye] + (Nas)
We major?  (C'mon homey we major)
We MAJOR?!  (C'mon homey we major)
We major  (C'mon homey we major)
We major...

[Tony Williams]
Feeling better than I ever felt before today
But better late than never, it's
Orien-tation, still we can make it better
Throwin all your cares away...

[music starts to fade until 5:21 in the song]

[Kanye West]
Can I talk my shit again?
Can I talk my shit again?!
I can't believe I'm back up in this muh'fucker
I'ma be late though
I gotta figure out what I'm gonna wear
Yeah... the Roc is definitely in the building
Good music's definitely in the building
I gotta say what's up to Tony Williams
On the vocals sings, he sings quite beautifully
Don't you agree?  Don't you agree?
Uhh, and Jon Brion on the keys right now
And Warren Campbell on the keys right now
So they ask me - why you call it &quot;Late Registration&quot; 'Ye?
Cause we takin these muh'fuckers back to school
If you know this part right here, feel free to sing along

[Tony Williams] + (Kanye West)
Feeling better than I ever felt before today (If you feelin good)
But better late than never; it's orien-tation (It's orientation)
Still we can make it better
Throwin all your cares away... (We want you to get used to this)
(Uhh, they cain't do what we do baby)
(Uh-uh, uh-uh, they cain't do what we do baby)
(Uh-uh, uh-uh, they cain't do what we do baby)
(Yeah...)&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;[Intro]
I want everybody to put they hands together for me
I want to talk about somebody real special tonight (whooooaaaa)
ok, come on

[Chorus]
Hey Mama, ahhhhhhhhhh, I wanna scream so loud for you
'Cause I'm so proud of you, let me tell you what I'm about to do (Hey Mama)
I know I act a fool, but I promise you I'm going back to school
I appreciate that you alive for me, I just want you to be proud of me (Hey Mama)

[Verse 1]
I want to tell the whole world about a friend of mine
This little light of mine, I'm feelin' let it shine
I'm feelin' take y'all back to them better times
I'm feelin' talk about my momma if y'all don't mind (Hey Mama)
I was 3 years old when you and I move to the Chi
Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold
You fix me up something that was good for my soul
Famous home chicken soup, can I have another bowl (Hey Mama)
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I can keep on my bike
And you would give me anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and the glove, but didn't give me a curl (Hey Mama)
And you never put no man over me, and I love you for that mommy can't you see
Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes
'Cause a nigga cheat and telling you lies, then I started to cry (Hey Mama)
As we knelt on the kitchen floor, I said mommy I'm a love you 'till you don't hurt no more
And when I'm older, you ain't got to work no more
And I'm a get you that mansion that we couldn't afford (Hey Mama)
See your unbreakable, unmistakable, highly capable, lady that's making loot
A living legend too, just look at what heaven do, send us an angel, and I thank you

[Chorus]
Hey Mama, ahhhhhhhhhh, I wanna scream so loud for you
'Cause I'm so proud of you, let me tell you what I'm about to do (Hey Mama)
I know I act a fool, but I promise you I'm going back to school
I appreciate that you alive for me, I just want you to be proud of me (Hey Mama)

[Verse 2]
Forest Gump momma said, life was like a box of chocolates
My momma told me go to school, get your doctorate
Something to fall back on, you can profit with
But still supported me when I did the opposite (Hey Mama)
Now I feel like there's things I gotta get, things I gotta do
Just to prove to you, you was getting through
Can the choir please, gimme a verse of you, eyes so beautiful, to me (Hey Mama)
Can't you see, you're like a book of poetry, Maya Angelou, Nikki Giovanni
Turn one page and there's my mommy (Hey Mama)
Come on mommy just dance with me, let the whole world see you dance with thee
Now when I say hey, y'all say mama
Now everybody answer me

[Chorus]
Hey Mama, ahhhhhhhhhh, I wanna scream so loud for you
'Cause I'm so proud of you, let me tell you what I'm about to do (Hey Mama)
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm going back to school
I appreciate that you alive for me, I just want you to be proud of me (Hey Mama)

[Interlude]
I guess it all depends though, if my ends low
Second they get up you gon' get that Benzo, tint the windows
Ride around the city and let your friends know (Hey Mama)

[Verse 3]
Tell your job you gotta fake 'em out
Since you brought me in this world let me take you out
To a restaurant, up a echelon(?) I'm a get you a Jag whateva else you want (Hey Mama)
Just tell me what kind of S-Type Donda West like
Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right
It don't gotta be Mother's Day, or your birthday, for me to just call and say

[Chorus/Outro]
Hey Mama, ahhhhhhhhhh, I wanna scream so loud for you
'Cause I'm so proud of you, let me tell you what I'm about to do (Hey Mama)
You know I love you so, I'm gonna let you go
I made this song just so you know no matter where you go I'm a love you..&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;But it's too late, it's too late
He, gone

[Kanye West]
You sweat her, and I ain't talkin 'bout a Coogi
You a big L, and I ain't talkin 'bout Cool J
See me at the airport, at least 20 Louis
Treat me like the Prince and this my sweet brother Numpsay
BROTHER NUMPSAY!  Groupies sound too choosy
Take 'em to the show and talk all through the movies
Says she want diamonds, I took her to Ruby Tuesdays
If we up in Friday's, I still have it my way

[Chorus]
Too late, we, gone - we strivin home
Gone - we ride on chrome
It's too late

[Kanye West]
Y'all don't want no prob from me
What you rappers could get is a job from me
Maybe you could be my intern, and in turn
I'll show you how I cook up summer, in the win-turr
Aaron love the raw dog, when will he learn
Caught somethin on the Usher tour he had to &quot;Let it Burn&quot;
Plus he already got three chil'run
Arguin over babysitters like, &quot;Bitch - it's yo' turn!&quot;
Damn 'Ye, it'd be stupid to ditch you
Even your superficial raps is super official
R-R-R-Roc pastel with Gucci on
With TV's in the ride, throw a movie on
Said he couldn't rap now he at the top where dude belong
Cause I dookied on any song that they threw me on, gone

[Chorus]
We strivin home, gone
[Cam] I ride on chrome...
We strivin home, gone
[Cam] Killa, I ride on chrome

[Cam'Ron]
Knock knock, who's there?  Killa Cam, Killa who?
Killa Cam, hustler, grinder, gorilla true
Oh my chinchilla blue, blue you ever dealt with a dealer
Well here's the deal ma we goin to the {?}
No concealin, no ceiling I don't need a roof
Act up, get out, I don't need you poof
Poof, be gone, damn tough luck dag
Dag, niggaz still doin puff puff pass
Pull the truck up fast and I tell 'em
Hey, back in a touched up Jag, shit
Y'all niggaz want Killa Cam, cerebellum
An old man just gon' tell 'em (too late, he, gone)
Then I see how y'all gonna react when I'm (gone)
My last girl want me back then I'm on
Fine stay, you got the grind hey
Came back, read what the sign say (too late, he, gone)
Yes I know you wanna see my demise
Yeah you church boy actin like a thief in disguise
Ain't leavin my side, see the greed in my eyes
Ask Abby y'all hustle for a week to the Chi, shit
And that ain't leavin alive, please believe me
Gave Weezy a piece of the pie, and
You can ask George or Regina
The whole Westside I explore with the Beemer now

[Chorus]
We strivin home, I ride on chrome
Listen homeboy move on
That's your best bet, why's that?
Cause

[Consequence]
Uhh, uhh, yo, yo
I been pourin out some liquor for the fact that my pal's gone
And tryin to help his momma with the fact that her child gone
And since we used to bubble like a tub full of Calgon
Guess it's only right that I should help her from now on
But since they got a foul on, what coulda gone wrong
Now they askin Cons, how long has this gone on
And maybe all this money mighta gone to my head
Cause they got me thinkin money mighta gone to the feds
So I ain't goin to the dread, but he'll go on up to bed
And when I came the next mornin he was gone with my bread
And with that bein said, I had gone on my instincts
And gone to the spots where they go to get mixed drinks
But lookin back now shoulda gone to the crib
And rented &quot;Gone With the Wind,&quot; cause I'da gone about 10
But I had gone with my friend, and we had gone to the bar
And heard a nigga talkin shit so I had gone to the car
And now the judge is tellin me that I had gone too far
And now we gone for 20 years, doin time behind bars
And since I gone to a cell for some cruddy crimes
I guess I gone to the well one too many times, cause I'm gone

[long instrumental pause]

[Kanye West imitating &quot;The Show&quot; at first]
Uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh uh uh onnn, uh uh-uh onnn
Uh-uh onnn, uh uh-uh I'mmmm
Ah-head of my time, sometimes years out
So the powers that be won't let me get my ideas out
And that make me wanna get my advance out
And move to Oklahoma and just live at my Aunt's house
Yeah, I romance the thought of leavin it all behind
Kanye step away from the lime-
-light, like, when I was on the grind
In the &quot;One, Nine, Nine, Nine&quot;
Before, model chicks was bendin over or
Dealerships asked me Benz or Rover, man
If I could just get one beat on Hova
We could get up off this cheap-ass sofa
What the summer of the Chi got to offer an 18-year-old
Sell drugs or get a job, you gotta play gyro
My dawg worked at Taco Bell, hooked us up plural-fied
A week later the manager count the churros
Sometimes I can't believe it when I look up in the mirrow
How we out in Europe, spendin Euros
They claim you never know what you got 'til it's GONE
I know I got it, I don't know what y'all on
I'ma open up a store for aspiring MC's
Won't sell 'em no dream, but the inspiration is free
But if they ever flip sides like Anakin
You'll sell everything includin the mannequin
They got a new bitch now you Jennifer Aniston
Hold on I'll handle it, don't start panickin, stay calm
Shorty's at the door cause they need more
Inspiration for they life, they souls, and they songs
They said sorry Mr. West is gone!&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;[Chorus: Kanye West]
I'll be late for that, baby I'll wait for that
If you had a taste of that, you'd probably pay for that
I'm comin in when I feel like
To turn this muh'fucker up only if it feels right
I'll be late for that, I can't wait for that
I think I was made for that
So I'm comin in when I feel like
To turn this muh'fucker up only if it feels right

[Kanye West]
Stop all your blood claat cryin, I was flyin
Made it to school with barely 'nuff time to sign in
Yeah I hear the alarm, yeah I hear you mom
Yeah yeah I don't wan' be broke when I'm 31
They said the best classes go to the fastest
Sorry Mr. West there's no good classes, and that's what yo' ass get
Not even electives?  Not even prerequits?
You mean I missed my major by a couple of seconds?
Now I'm in the shop class or the basket weavin
With all the rest of the muh'fuckers underachievin
Man, this is a insult
I went to junior high with all of them and they been slow
If I can catch the beat then slow down the tempo
Just notice at the end if I'm too late for the intro
Will I make it from the student loans to a Benz-o?
Like old folks pissin, I guess it all +Depends+, oh, oh
... Stop you're cryin baby

[Chorus]

[Kanye West]
You know when you be late you miss all the lights
That's right (that's right) that's right (that's right)
And when you get back she gon' start up a fight
That night (that night) that night
Baby it's too late for that, lately I've been takin it slow
Try and make it to the party 'fore the guest list close
With the freshest hoes, the professors know
We about to get real unprofessional
Like them eskimos, what would you do for a Klondike?
Or two dykes that look Christina Milian like
Hmmm, I'll be on time for that
I ain't thought of no line that could rhyme with that
Yo, I'll be there in five minutes, five hours later
I'll be there in five minutes, go 'head ride with it
I'm so live with it, look how I did it
Been bullshittin but I finally arrived with it
I know it's late and I took all year but
You can stop complainin cause I'm finally here, yeah

&quot;I'll be late for that&quot; - repeat 4X&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;[Kanye West]
(&quot;Make It Up&quot;) We can make it better
(&quot;Make It Up&quot;) We can make it better
(&quot;Make It Up&quot;) We can make it better
(&quot;Make It Up&quot;) We can make it

Somebody told me that Delta's brownskinned, AKAs' lightskinned
And they supposed to be bougious, so they got white friends
First day of school, I'mma take you sight seein'
Show you what we do on weekends for a sight, man
She said, &quot;I know what you about to say, like your hypeman&quot;
She let a nigga hit it, and now she only date white men
And if a nigga even wave at her, it's frightnin'; but

[Chorus: Kanye West]
(&quot;Make It Up&quot;) We can make it better
(Better we can)
(&quot;Make It Up&quot;) We can make it better
(Better we can make it on up, we can)
(&quot;Make It Up&quot;) We can make it better
(Better we can)
(&quot;Make It Up&quot;) We can make it

[Talib Kweli]
The night fallin' over Brooklyn, where they murder for change
The converter remains faithful to the drugdealer priestess
He in search of the word of fame, you heard of the name
Kweli the truth, like I'm comin' out the mouth of (?)
One for it, one for out the grave
Niggaz want they reperations, How you calculate the amount to be paid
You try to imagine America without the slaves (the slaves)

[Chorus]

[Q-Tip]
Her tenament yo, is rat infested
Her heart is like a gold (?) cause she wouldn't protest it
Cause, her bestfriend's man got popped
He was sixteen years old, the cop thought his phone was a glock
In the hood is a everday happenin'
A friend of the priest say she chose out the captain
She yelled out &quot;Why you do this to black men?&quot;

[Chorus]

[Common]
I think of eighty seven ways, to make better days
Whether climb or rhyme, I heard of rebel pays
On the scene, tryin' to get green like everglades
Music, rhymin' good like escalates
In the ghetto infested by shade and drama
And niggaz wit' thangs ain't afraid of karma
I'm thinkin' big like Little Wayne in the (?)

[Chorus]

[Rhymefest]
C'mon; Tell people the truth, but never give 'em ya true thoughts
Terrorism on blacks, they poison our Newports
Partiot Act in effect, make it hard to breathe now
Johnny Cochran dead, who gonna get us free now?
Clinton ain't in office, who gon' give us shit free now?
Who gon' make it better for the thugs and Ps now?
Who gon' make it good for old folks that's senile?
Oh, it's good music, yeah dog I see now

[Chorus]&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;[Intro]
Oh yeah, I got the perfect song for the kids to sing
And all my people that's

[Chorus (Kanye 1-2, 4-7)]
[1] Drug dealin' just to get by
[2] stackin' money 'till it get sky high
[3]   (kids, sing. kids, sing)
[4] We wasn't supposed to make it past 25
[5] Joke's on you, we still alive
[6] Throw your hands up in the sky and yell
[7] We don't care what people say

[Verse 1]
If this is your first time hearin' this
You are about to experience something so cold, man
We never had nothin' handed
Took nothin' for granted
Took nothin' from no man
Man I'm my own man
But as a shorty I looked up to the dope man
Only adult man I knew that wasn't broke, man
Flickin' Starter coats, man
Man you don't know, man
We don't care what people say

This is for my niggas outside all winter
'Cause this summer they ain't finna'
Say next summer I'm finna'
Sittin' in the hood like community colleges
This dope money here is little Tre's scholarship
'Cause ain't no tuition for having no ambition
And ain't no loans for sittin' your ass at home
So we forced to sell crack, rap, and get a job
You gotta do somethin' man, your ass is grown

[Chorus (Kanye 1-3, kids 4-6)]

[Verse 2]
The second verse is for my dawgs workin 9 to 5
That still hustle 'cause a nigga can't shine off $6.55
And everybody selling makeup, Jacob's
And bootlegged tapes just to get they cake up
We put shit on layaway, then come back
We claim other people kids on our income tax
We take that money, cop work, then push packs to get paid
And we don't care what people say
Momma say she wanna move south
Scratchin' lottery tickets, eyes on a new house
'Round the same time, Doe ran up in dude house
Couldn't get a job, so since he couldn't get work
He figured he'd take work
The drug game bulimic, it's hard to get weight
A nigga's money is homo, it's hard to get straight
But we gon' keep bakin' 'till the day we get cake
And we don't care what people say
My niggas

[Chorus (kids 1-2, 4-6; Kanye 3)]

[Verse 3]
You know the kids gon' act a fool
When you stop the programs for after school
And they DCFS, some of em dyslexic
They favorite 50-Cent song +12 questions+
We scream, rock, blows, weed, park
See now we smart
We ain't retards, the way teachers starve
Hold up, hold fast. We make more cash
Now tell my momma I belong in that slow class
Bad enough we on welfare
They tryin to put me on the school bus with the space for the wheelchair
I'm trying to get the car with the chromie wheels here
They trying to cut our lights out like we don't live here
Look what was handed us
Fathers abandoned us
When we get them hammers, go on call the ambulance
Sometimes I feel no one in this world understands us
But we don't care what people say
My niggas

[Chorus (kids 1-2, 4-6; Kanye 3)]&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;[Chorus - 4x]
Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm telling you ohh, it all falls down

[Verse - Kanye West]
Man I promise, she's so self conscious
She has no idea what she's doing in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurrre
The concept of school seems so securrre
Sophmore three yearrrs aint picked a careerrr
She like fuck it, I'll just stay down herre and do hair
Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs
Cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexus [a Lexus]
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off now she look like Eve
And she be dealing with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail and well

[Chorus - repeat 2x] (w/ Kanye ad-libs)

[Verse - Kanye West]
Man I promise, I'm so self conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pasha's done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that versace!
Then I spent 400 bucks on this
Just to be like nigga you ain't up on this!
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some ones thats clean and a shirt with a team
It seems we living the american dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss cause they degrade us
We trying to buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we a'stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coop/coupe

[Chorus - repeat 2x] (w/ Kanye ad-libs)

[Verse - Kanye West]
I say fuck the police, thats how I treat em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes when we don't really need em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
Cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shortys hollering &quot;where the ballas' at?&quot;
Drug dealer buy Jordans, crackhead buy crack
And a white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gon act holier than thou
Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
Cause I wanna be on 106 and Park pushing a Benz
I wanna act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spending before I get it
We all self conscious I'm just the first to admit it

[Chorus - to fade] (w/ Kanye ad-libs)&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;[Chorus: Kanye West]
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Man, man, man
If my manager insults me again I will be assaulting him
After I fuck the manager up then I'm gonna shorten the register up
Let's go back, back to the Gap
Look at my check, wasn't no scratch
So if I stole, wasn't my fault
Yeah I stole, never got caught
They take me to the back and pat me
Askin' me about some khakis
But let some black people walk in
I bet they show off their token blackie
Oh now they love Kanye, let's put him all in the front of the store
Saw him on break next to the 'No Smoking' sign with a blunt and a Marl'
Takin' my hits, writin' my hits
Writin' my rhymes, playin' my mind
This fuckin' job can't help him
So I quit, y'all welcome
Y'all don't know my struggle
Y'all can't match my hustle
You can't catch my hustle
You can't fathom my love dude
Lock yourself in a room doin' five beats a day for three summers
That's a +Different World+ like +Cree Summers+
I deserve to do these numbers
The kid that made that deserves that Maebach
So many records in my basement
I'm just waitin' on my spaceship, blaow

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: GLC]
Man, I'm talkin' way past the sky
Let's go, yeah
And I didn't even try to work a job
Represent the mob
At the same time thirsty on the grind
Chi state of mind
Lost my momma, lost my mind
+My life, my love+ that's not mine
Why you ain't signed?
Wasn't my time
Leave me alone, work for y'all
Half of it's yours, half of it's mine
Only one to ball
Never one to fall
Gotta get mine
Gotta take mine
Got a tech nine
Reach my prime
Gotta make these haters respect mine
In the mall 'til 12 when my schedule wore headset nine
Puttin' known ass on shelves
Waitin' paitently I ask myself
Qhere I wanna go, where I wanna be
Life is much more than runnin' in the streets
Holla at 'ye, hit me with the beat
Put me on my feet
Sound so sweet
Yes I'm the same ol' G, same goatee
Stayin' low key, nope
Holler at God &quot;Man why'd you had to take my folks?&quot;
Hope to see Freddy G., Yusef G
Love my G, Rolly G
Police watch me smoke my weed, count my G's
Got a lot of people countin' on me
And I'm just tryin' to find my peace
Should of finished school like my niece
Then I wouldn't finally wouldn't use my piece, blaow
Aw man, all this pressure

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Consequence]
I remember havin' to take the dollar cab
Comin' home real late at night
Standin' on my feet all damn day
Tryin' to make this thing right
And havin' one of my co-workers say &quot;Yo you look just like
This kid I seen in the old Busta Rhymes video the other night&quot;
Well easy come, easy go
How that sayin' goes
No more broad service, cars, and them TV shows
I all had that snatched from me
And all the faculties all turn their back on me
And didn't wanna hear a rap from me
So naturally actually had to face things factually
Had to be a catastrophe with the fridgest starin' back at me
Cuz nothing's there, nothing's fair
I don't wanna ever go back there
So I won't be takin' no days off 'til my spaceship takes off

[Chorus]

[Outro: Kanye West]
I wanna fly, I wanna fly
I said I want my chariot to pick me up
And take me brother for a ride&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Yo, We at war
We at war with terrorism, racism but most of all we at war with ourselves
(Jesus Walks)
God show me the way because the Devil trying to break me down
(Jesus Walks with me) with me with me with me (fades)

You know what the Midwest is?  Young &amp; Restless
Where restless Niggaz might snatch your necklace
And next these Niggaz might jack your Lexus
Somebody tell these Niggaz who Kanye West is
I walk through the valley of Chi where death is
Top floor the view alone will leave you breathless Uhhhh!
Try to catch it Uhhhh! It's kinda hard hard
Getting choked by the detectives yeah yeah now check the method
They be asking us questions, harass and arrest us
Saying &quot;we eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast&quot;
Huh? Yall eat pieces of shit? What's the basis?
We ain't going nowhere but got suits and cases
A trunk full of coke rental car from Avis
My momma used to say only Jesus can save us
Well momma I know I act a fool
But I'll be gone til November I got packs to move I Hope

(HOOK x 2)
(Jesus Walks)
God show me the way because the Devil trying to break me down
(Jesus Walks with me)
The only thing that I pray is that me feet don't fail me now
(Jesus Walks)
And I don't think there is nothing I can do now to right my wrongs
(Jesus Walks with me)
I want to talk to God but I'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long

To the hustlas, killers, murderers, drug dealers even the strippers
To the victims of Welfare for we living in hell here hell yeah
Now hear ye hear ye want to see Thee more clearly
I know he hear me when my feet get weary
Cuz we're the almost nearly extinct
We rappers are role models we rap we don't think
I ain't here to argue about his facial features
Or here to convert atheists into believers
I'm just trying to say the way school need teachers
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis that's the way yall need Jesus
So here go my single dog radio needs this
They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns, sex, lies, video tapes
But if I talk about God my record won't get played Huh?
Well let this take away from my spins
Which will probably take away from my ends
Then I hope this take away from my sins
And bring the day that I'm dreaming about
Next time I'm in the club everybody screaming out

(Jesus Walks)
God show me the way because the devil trying to break me down
(Jesus Walks)
The only thing that I pray is that me feet don't fail me now&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;[Chorus]
When it comes to being true, he's true to me
One thing I found, one thing I found
Oh no you never let me down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down

[Jay-Z]
Yo, first I snatched the streets then I snatched the charts
First I had they ear, now I have their heart
Rappers came and went, I've been here from the start
I seen them put it together, watched them take it apart
Seen the rovers roll up wit ribbons
I seen them re-po'd, re-sold then re-driven
So when I reload, he holds #1 position
When you hot I'm hot
And when your feet cold, mines is sizzelin
It's plain to see, niggaz can't fuck with me
Cuz I'm a be that nigga for life
This is not an image, this is God given
This is hard livin, mixed with crystall sippin
It's the most consistent, Hov
Give you the most hits you can fit inside a whole disc and
Nigga I'm home on these charts, y'all niggaz visitin
It's Hov tradition, Jeff Gordan of rap
I'm back to claim pole position, holla at ya boy

[Chorus overlapping last four lines]

[Kanye West]
I get down for my grandfather who took my momma
Made her sit in that seat where white folks ain't want us to eat
At the tender age of 6 she was arrested for the sit in
And with that in my blood I was born to be different
Now niggaz can't make it to ballots to choose leadership
But we can make it to Jacob's and to the dealership
Swear I hear new music and I just don't be feelin it
Racisms still alive, they just be concealin it
But I know they don't want me in the damn club
They even make me show I.D to get inside of Sam's club
I done did dirt and went to church and get my hands scrubbed
Swear I've been baptized least 3 or 4 times
But in the land where niggaz praise Yukons and getting paid
Its gon take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
Like it take a lot more than durags to get you waves
Nothing sad as that day my girl's father past away
So I promised to Mr. Rany I'm gonna marry your daughter
And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
And I know that you were smiling when you see the car I bought her
You sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up
But I can't complain what the accident did to my left eye
Cuz look what an accident did to Left Eye
First Aaliyah now romeo must die?
I know I got angels watchin me from the other side

[Chorus]

[J.Ivy]
We are all here for a reason on a particular path
You don't need a curriculum to know that you're apart of the math
Cats think I'm delirious but I'm so damn serious
That's why I expose my soul to the globe; the world
I'm tryna make it better for these little boys and girls
I'm not just another individual
My spirit is a part of this that's why it's spiritual
But I get my hymns from him
So it's not me it's he that's lyrical
I'm not a miracle, I'm a heaven sent instrument
My rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes
For your soul and your mental
That's why I'm instrumental, vibrations is what I'm into
Yeah I need my loot by rent day
But that ain't what gives me the heart of Kunta Kinte
I'm tryna give us us free like Sinke
I can't stop, that's why I'm hot
Determination, dedication, motivation
I'm talking to you of my many inspirations
When I say I can't let you or self down
If I were on the highest cliff, on the highest riff
And if you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life
In my grip I would never ever let you down
And when these words are found
Let it be known that God's penmanship has been signed
With a language called love
That's why my breath is felt by the deaf
And why my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
I too dream in color and in rhyme
So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house
Cuz whenever I open my heart, my soul or my mouth
A touch of god reigns out

[Chorus]

[Jay-Z]
Who else you know been hot this long
Started from nothing but he got this strong
Built the ROC from a pebble, peddled rock before I met you
Peddled bikes, got my nephews peddle bikes because they special
Let you tell it man I'm fallin well
Somebody must have caught hI'm cuz
Every fourth quarter, I like to Mike Jordan em
Number one albums what I got, like four of em
More of them on the way, the 8th wonder on the way
Clear the way, I'm here to stay
Y'all can save the chitter chat, this and that
This is Jay, dissin Jay will get you Mase'd
When I start spittin them lyrics niggaz get very religious
Six hail mary's please father forgive us
Young, the archbishop, the Pope John Paul of y'all niggaz
They way y'all all follow Jigga
Hov's a livin legend and I'll tell you why
Everybody wanna be Hov and Hov's still alive&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;[Kanye West]
I'm tryin to catch the beat, uh
I'm tryin to catch the beat
I'm tryin to catch the beat, uh uh, uh
I'm tryin to catch the beat

[Chorus: Kanye West]
N-now, th-th-through ya motherfuckin hands
GET EM HIGH
All the girls pass the weed to ya motherfuckin man
GET EM HIGH
Now I ain't never tell you to put down ya hands
KEEP EM HIGH
And if ya losin yo high than smoke again
KEEP EM HIGH

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
N-n-n-now, my flow
Is in the pocket like Wallace, I got the bounce like hydrolics
I can't call it, I got the swerve like alchoooool-ics
My freshman year I was goin through hell, a problem
Still I, built up the nerve to drop my ass up outta collllllll-ege
My teacher said I'se a loser, I told her why don't you kill me
I give a fuck if you fail me, I'm gonna folllllllllll-ow
My heart, and if you follow the charts, to the plaques or the stacks
You ain't gotta guess who's back, you see
I'm so shy that you thought it was bashfull but this
Bastards flow will bash a skull
And I will, cut your girl like Pastor Tro
And I don't, usualy smoke but pass the dro
And I won't, give you that money that you askin fo'
Why you think, me and Dame cool, we ass holes
That's why we here your music in fast fo'
Cuz we don't wanna here that weak shit no mo'

[Chorus: Kanye West]
N-now, th-th-through ya motherfuckin hands
GET EM HIGH
All the girls pass the weed to ya motherfuckin man
GET EM HIGH
Now I ain't never tell you to put down ya hands
KEEP EM HIGH
And if ya losin yo high than smoke again
KEEP EM HIGH

[Verse 2: Kanye West] + (girl)
N-n-n-n-n-now who the hell is this
E-mailin me at 11:26, tellin me that she 36-26, plus double-d
You know how girls on black planet be when they get bubblee
At NYU but she headed from Kansas
Right now she just lampin, chillin on campus
Sent me a picture with a feelin on Candice
Who said her favorite rapper was the late great Francis
W-H-I-T, it's gettin late mami, your screen saver say tweet
So you got to call me, and bring a friend for my friend
His name Kweli (You mean Talib, lyric sticks to your rib)
I mean (That's my favorite CD that I play at my crib)
I mean (You don't really know him, why is you lyin)
Yo Kwe, she don't believe me, please pickup the line
She gon' think that I'm lyin, just spit a couple of lines
Then maybe I'll be able to give her dick all the time, and get her high

[Verse 3: Talib Kweli]
Yeah
I can't believe this nigga use my name for pickin up dimes but never mind
(Get Em High!)
I need some tracks you tryin to pull tracks out
And my rhymes as fittin to blow you tryin to blow backs out
Well ok (Get Em High)
You twisted my arm, I'll asist with the charm, aiyyo
Ain't you meet that chick at that conference with yo moms
And she's the bomb (Get Em High)
Boy she got the bouji behavior
Always got somethin to say like a okayplaya hater
(Keep Em High) Anyway, I don't usualy fuck a interneter
Chicks with birth control stuck to they arm like Nicorette
You really fuckin that much, you tryin to get off cigarettes
If she think it's fly, she ain't met a real nigga yet
I appoligize if I come off a little inconsiderate
I got the bubble cushion a sister could get a hit of it

[Verse 4: Common]
Get em high like noon, or the moon or room filled with smoke
A high filled with dope
Y'all assumed I was doomed, out of tune, but I still feel the notes
The real nigga quotes
Real rappers is hard to find, like a remonte, control rap is not a
Used soup it still got life, that's why I abuse you who are not thugs
Rock clubs, it's like Tiger, Woods in the hood, to have my own reality show
Called Soul Survivor, I stole all liver, niggaz in you
You'se a bitch I got ones that are thicker than you
How could I ever let your words affect me, they say Hip-Hop is dead
I'm here to resurrect me, mosh is to sexy to even make songs like these
That's why the raw don't know your name, like Alicia Keys
To many featured emcees, and pro-ducers is populer
Twelve thousand spins, nobody got to coppin her
Album, how come, you the hot garbager
The years clear your image and snooped up
Label got you souped up, tellin you you sick
Man you a dick with a loose nut
Video hard to watch like Medusa
Even your club record need a booster
Chimped up, with a pimp cup, illeaterate nigga
Read the infa, red across your head I'm bread king like Simba
Bolder then Denver, I ain't a Madd Rapper just a emcee with a temper
You dansin for money like honey, I did this my way
So when the industry crash, I survive like Kanye
Spittin through wires and fires, emcees retirin
Got yo hands up, get them motherfuckers higher then

[Chorus: Kanye West]
N-now, th-th-through ya motherfuckin hands
GET EM HIGH
All the girls pass the weed to ya motherfuckin man
GET EM HIGH
Now I ain't never tell you to put down ya hands
KEEP EM HIGH
And if ya losin yo high than smoke again
KEEP EM HIGH&lt;/lyrics&gt;

Artist: [[Kanye West]]&lt;br&gt;
Album: [[Kanye West:The College Dropout (2004)|The College Dropout]]
----

&lt;lyrics&gt;
[Intro]
You just popped in the Kanye West 
Get right for the summer workout tape
And ladies if you follow these instructions exactly
you might bear to pull you a rapper, a NBA player
Man, at least a dude wit' a car
So first of all we gon' work on the stomach
Nobody wants a little tight ass!

[Verse 1]
1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and get them sit ups right and
Tuck your tummy tight and do your crunches like this
Give head, stop breathe, get up, check your weave
Don't drop the blunt and disrespect the weed
Pick up your son and don't disrespect your seed
It's a party tonight and ooh she's so excited
Tell me who's invited: you, your friends and my dick
What's scary to me is Henny makes girls look like Halle Berry to me
So excuse me miss, I forgot your name
Thank you, God bless you, good night I came...
I came....
I came...

[Chorus]
It's been a week without me
and she feel weak without me
She wanna talk it out but
Ain't nothin' to talk about
'Lest, she talkin' about freakin' out
then maybe we can work it out
Work it out (Come on) 4x
Work it out now
Maybe we can work it out (Come on, come on)

[Verse 2]
Oh girl your silhouette make me wanna light a cigarette
My name Kanye from the Jigga set Twista set get it wet
Ooh girl your breath is HARSH
Cover your mouth up like you got SARS
Off them tracks yea I bought them cars
Still killa a nigga on 16 bars
We ain't sweatin' to the oldies we jukin to a cold beat
Maybe one day girl we can bone 
so you can brag to all your homies now
But I still mess with a big firl if you ain't fit girl I'll hit girl
1 and you brought 2 friends OK 3 more now hop in the Benz
Four door do you know the difference between a 5, 6, 7, 8
All the mocha lattes you gotta do Pilates
You gotta pop this tape in before you start back dating
Hustlers, gangstas, all us, ballas

[Chorus]
It's been a week without me
and she feel weak without me
She wanna talk it out but
Ain't nothin' to talk about
'Lest, she talkin' about freakin' out
then maybe we can work it out
Work it out (Come on) 4x
Work it out now
Maybe we can work it out (Come on, come on)

[Interlude: Ladies speaking w/ Kanye in the background]

&lt;lyrics&gt;[Intro: Luther (Jamie Foxx)]
Are you gonna be? Say that you're gonna be
Oooo, oooo, oooo, oooo, oooooo

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx (Luther)]
She said she want some Marvin Gaye, some Luther Vandross
A little Anita will definitely set this party off right
(are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be
are you gonna be, are you gonna be, well well well well)
She said she want some Ready For The World, some New Edition
Some Minnie Ripperton will definitely set this party off right
(are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be
are you gonna be, are you gonna be, well well well well)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
(*talking*)
It definitely will
You know what I told her
(*rapping)
I told her to drive over in yo new whip, bring some friends you cool wit
I'mma bring the cool whip, then I want you to strip
See you is my new chick, so we get our grind on
She be grabbin me, callin me +Biggie+ like +Shyne+ home
Man I swear she fine homes, why she always lyin though?
Tellin me them diamonds, when she know they rhinestones
She got a light-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
Got a dark-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
I played 'ready for the world', she was ready for some action
My dawg said you ain't no freak , so you bout to prove my man wrong
I'mma lay this Vandross, you gon take yo pants off
I'mma play this Gladys Knight, me and you gon get right

Repeat Chorus

[Bridge: Jamie Foxx]

Yes it will, yes it will (Well well well well)
Al Green, OH!
Al Green, OHHHHH YEAH!!!
OOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
Whatcha know about the Isley Brothers?

[*Aisha Taylor talking over ad-libs*]
Now Kanye, I know I told you to slow it down
It's good, it's all good, it's beautiful
But now I need you to do it faster baby
can you please - do it faster, do it faster

[*Kanye talking*]
Damn baby, I can't do it that fast but I know somebody who can, Twista!

[Verse 2: Twista]
When I catch you looking at the glist on my hands and wrist
While I'm layin' back smoking on my cannabis
When it come to rockin the rhythm like Marvin and Luther
I can tell you when I'm messin wit Kan man and Twist
In the Chi and I be sippin hennessey - play some R&amp;B
While I smoke a b - you can preferably find that I'm a G
And all this (well well well well)
Come wit me and sip on some Evelyn Champagne
You ain't know Twista could work it like the Whispers?
Hit the stop light, move it to some Isaac
His rims still movin so I bump a lil' Spinners
While I'm smoking on a b - dippin through the streets
Bumpin R&amp;B - and I got the leaf - on the 23's
And I do it (well well well well)
Wit my Earth in the Wind smoking Fire
Let me get ya sheets wet listenin to Keith Sweat
Put you in a daze wit Maze
Fulfilling her wit every temptation, slow jam, and havin deep sex
You ready for the world girl, baby come on go wit me
I touch you all over your body baby don't say no to me
And every moment controlling me
I love the way you be holdin me when I be listenin to Jodeci
And when I come over and bend ya ass, you be bumpin Teddy Pendergrass
I done hit it from the back, to the melody and rode it slow
Now I got to go up in it fast, but I'mma finish last
No matter how much of a thug you see
I still spit it like it's R&amp;B, come to the club wit me
And when some Luther come on I hope you feelin me
and still will be in love wit me

Repeat Chorus

Bridge 2: Jamie Foxx ad-libs (w/ female singer)

Repeat Chorus&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;[Hook: Ludacris]
Yeah, breathe in, breathe out
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out
Girls go wild and pull ya deez out
Breathe in, breathe out
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out
When I pull the piece out niggas like &quot;Peace out!&quot;

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Golly, more of that bullshit ice rap
I got to 'pologize to Mos and Kweli (probably)
But is it cool to rap about gold
If I told the world I copped it from Ghana and Mali? (Mali!)
First nigga with a Benz and a backpack
Ice chain, Cardi lens, and a knapsack
Always said if I rapped I'd say somethin' significant
But now I'm rappin' 'bout money, hoes, and rims again
And it's still about the Benjamins
Big faced hundreds and whatever other synonyms
Strippers named Cinnamon
More chips than Pentium
What'cha gon' buy next? Whatever new trend it is
I'm tryin' to spend my stacks
And I'm so broke I look back like &quot;Damn, was I on crack?&quot;
I mean twelve platinum chains, was I on that?
What the hell was wrong with me dog?
Sing along with my y'all

[Hook: Ludacris]
Yeah, breathe in, breathe out
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out
Girls go wild and pull ya deez out
Breathe in, breathe out
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out
When I pull the piece out niggas like &quot;Peace out!&quot;

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Now even though I went to college and dropped out of school quick
I always had a Ph.D.: a Pretty Huge Dick
Ladies tired of gettin' ripped off by guys like this
And givin' head is like 'oh well, the shoes and the toothpick'
Well, I'm in the club for a limited time
Act now and get some action for $3.99
Later on I might charge for ménage
Heard her man was the boss of the floss
But she still want to toss me the drawers
And it ain't gon' cost me because she my caddy
Cuz she grabbed my golf balls in the club
And I'm still actin' calm than a mug
She asked &quot;Can you drive me and the hunnies to where my Altima was?&quot;
While we drive she tellin' me 'bout problems with her man
Baby I fully understand
Let me help you with a plan
While he trickin' off, don't get no rich nigga
Give ME some head, that'll really piss hI'm off
{*inhales*}

[Hook: Ludacris]
Yeah, breathe in, breathe out
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out
Girls go wild and pull ya deez out
Breathe in, breathe out
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out
When I pull a piece out niggas like &quot;Peace out!&quot;

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I blow past low class niggas with no cash
In the fo' dash six, bitch you can go ask
So when I go fast popo just laugh
Right until I run out of gas or 'til I go crash
Whatever comes first I'm prepared for the worst
Whatever comes second I'll be there with my weapon
Pullin' up in the Lexuses/'lexeses, one on both hand
So I guess them GSes was ambidextrous
Coulda sworn her breasteses was sendin' me messages
&quot;K I need a free hand mammogram
I got weed, drink, and a Handicam
All of which is legal in Amsterdam&quot;
So say my name like Candyman
And I'ma come and fix you up like the handyman
But if you don't need a fix, girl you gotta leave
You can't take that all at one time ya gotta breathe

[Hook: Ludacris]
Yeah, breathe in, breathe out
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out
Girls go wild and pull ya deez out
Breathe in, breathe out
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out
When I pull a piece out niggas like &quot;Peace out!&quot;

*&quot;Can you say Chi city?&quot; scratched repeatedly*&lt;/lyrics&gt;

Never ever never come back in style
Told 'em I finished school, and I started my own business
They say, 'Oh you graduated?'
No, I decided I was finished
Chasin' y'all dreams and what you've got planned
Now I spit it so hot you got tanned
Back to school and I hate it there, I hate it there
Everything I want I gotta wait a year, I wait a year
This nigga graduated at the top of my class..
I went to Cheesecake, he was a motherfucking waiter there

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I got a Jones like Norah for your sorror'
Bring more of them girls I've seen in the Aurora

See, that's how dude became the young pootie tang tippy tow
Rocafella chain, yeah that's my rapper style
Rosary piece, yeah that's my Catholic style
Red and white One's, yeah that's my Kappa style
And I ain't even pledge
Crack my head on the steering wheel and I ain't even dead
If I could go through all that and still be breathing
Bitch bend over, I'm here for a reason

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I feel a woo coming on, cuz. I feel a woo coming on, cuz

&lt;lyrics&gt;[Kanye West]
We in the streets playa, getcha mail
It's only two places you'll end up - either dead or in jail
Still nowhere to go...still nowhere to go
Now throw ya hands up bustless, bustas, boostas, hoes
Everybody, fuck that
Still nowhere to go...sill nowhere to go..

[Mos Def]
Two words, United States, no love, no breaks
Low brow, high stakes, crack smoke, black folks
Big Macs, fat folks, ecstasy capsules
Presidential scandals, everybody MOVE
Two words, Mos Def, K West, hot shit
Calm down, get back, ghetto people, got this
Game ball, lock shit, dump off, cock shit
We won't stop shit, everybody MOVE
Two words, BK , NY, bedstuy
Two hawks, too hungry, too many, that's why
These streets know game, can't ball, don't play
Every traffic, one lane, everybody MOVE
Two words, Mos Def, black check, hot shit
Calm down, get back, ghetto people, got this
Game point lock, long pump cocked
We won't stop, everybody MOVE


Chorus: Kanye West (Harlem Boys Choir)

1 - Now throw ya hands up bustless, bustas (Throw your hands up high)
      Boostas, hoes, everybody, fuck that (ohhhhhh)
      Still nowhere to go...still nowhere to go... (ohhhhhh)

2 - and keep ya hands up bustless, bustas (Till they reach the sky)
      Boostas, hoes, everybody, fuck that (ohhhhhh)
      Still nowhere to go...still nowhere to go... (ohhhhhh)

[Kanye West] (Harlem Boys Choir)
Aiyyo, two words, Chi town, South side, world wide
Cuz I, rep that, till I, fuckin die
One neck, two chains, one waist, two gats
One wall, twenty plaques, dudes say, &quot;Gimme that&quot;
I am limelight, Blueprint, 5 Mics
Go get his rhyme like, shoulda been signed twice
Most imitated, Grammy nominated
Hotel accommodated, cheerleader, prom dated
Barbershop, playa hated, mom and pop, bootlegged it
Felt like it rained till the roof caved in
Two words, Chi town, raised me, crazy
So I live by two words, &quot;Fuck you, pay me&quot;
Screamin, Jesus save me
You know how the game be
I can't let em change me
Cuz on Judgment Day, you gon blame me
Look God, it's the same me
I (Throw) basically know now (Your) we could (Up) racially profile (High)
Cuffed up and hosed down, pimped up and hoe down (ohhhhhh)
Plus I got a whole city to hold down (ohhhhhh)
From the bottom so the top's the only place to go now


[Chorus 2nd verse]

[Freeway]
Two words, Freeway, two letters, A-R
Turn y'all rap niggaz into two words, fast runners
Like Jackie Jurner, you better sleep with your burner
The heat skeet, blow a reef through ya car My God
Two words, no guns, break arms
Break necks, break backs, Steven Segul
Free...young bars, fresh men of the Roc
Left the beef in the pot Jay sent for his dogs
and broads, forget ya squad, let em find for yourself
Have you screamin out four words &quot;Send for the Lord&quot;
Two words, Freeway's slightly retarded
Fuck around, throw a clip in ya artist, leave with his broad..

[Harlem Boys Choir] (Mos Def)
Throw... (red) Your... (white)

Throw... (calm) Your... (down)

&lt;lyrics&gt;Yo G, they can't stop me from rapping can they?
Can they huh?
I spit it through the wire man
Just too much stuff on my heart right now man
I'll gladly risk it all right now
It's a life or death situation man
Y'all don't really understand how I feel right now man
It's your boy Kayne to the....
Chi-Town what's goin on man

[Verse 1]
I drink a - Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dizzert
Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man be-serk
Not to worry Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wi-zzerk
How do you console my mom or give her life support
Telling her her son's on life support
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane, scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she been tryin to be mine
She a Delta, so she been throwin that +Dynasty+ sign
No use in me tryin to be lyin, I been tryin to resign
Trying to be a millionaire - HA! I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican man
Story on MTV and I ain't tryin to +Make a Band+
I swear this right here, history in the makin man

I really apologize how I sound right now man
This ain't fair at all man
They got my mouth wired shut for like
I don't know the doctor said like six weeks
You know we had reconstru....
I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw
I looked in the mirror, half of my jaw was in the back of my mouth
Man I couldn't believe it
But I'm still here for yall right now yo
This is what I gotta say yo
Yeah, turn me up yeah

[Verse 2]
What if somebody from the Chi that was ill got a deal
on the hottest rap label around
But he wasn't talking bout coke and birds it was more like spoken word
Except he's really puttin it down
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, Wrong time
in the blink of a eye - his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt, you would know how Mase felt
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God driver two wanna sue
I got a lawyer for the case to keep what's in my safe, safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I
I looked like Tom Cruise on +Vanilla Sky+, it was televised
All they heard was in accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must gotta angel
Cause look how death missed his ass
&quot;Unbreakable&quot;, what you thought they'd call me Mr. Glass
Look back on my life like the ghost of Christmas past
Toys R Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still wont grow up, I'm a grown ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire

Yaknahmsayin?
When the doctor told me I had a um...
I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin
I said dawg, don't you realize I'll never make it on my plane now?
Its bad I got all this jewelry on
You can't be serious man&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;[Intro: Kanye West]
How's your son? (all, all, all the things, things)
He make the team this year? (all, all, all the things things)
Aw th-, they said he wasn't tall enough?
(all, all, all the glitter in that gold)
Yeah me we gon' cook this up (now gold is not a reality)
(real is what you live to be)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
This is family business
And this is for the family that can't be with us
And this is for my cousin locked down, know the answer's in us
That's why I spit it in my songs so sweet
Like a photo of your granny's picture
Now that you're gone it hit us
Super hard on Thankgiving and Christmas, this can't be right
Yeah you heard the track I did man, this can't be light
Somebody please say grace so I can save face
And have a reason to cover my face
I even made you a plate, soul food, know how Granny do it
Pumpkin bread on the side, know how the family do it
When I brought it why did God have to look all to it?
As kids we used to laugh
Who knew that life would move this fast?
Who knew I'd have to look at you through a glass?
And look, tell me you ain't did it, you ain't did it
And if you did, then that's family business

[Hook: Choir]
And I don't care 'bout (all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)
They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)
All these fancy things
I tell you that all (all the glitter) I'm waiting for
Now all I know I know all these things

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
This is family business
And this is for everybody standin' with us
Come on, let's take a family Grammy picture
Hey B, remember when they ain't believe in me?
Now she like &quot;See, that's my cousin on TV&quot;
Now, we gettin' it and we gon' make it
And y'all gon' hate it and I'm his favorite
I can't deny it, I'm a straight rider
But when we get together be electric slidin'
Grandma, get 'em shook up
Aw naw, don't open the photo book up
I got an Aunt Ruth that can't remember your name
But I bet them Polaroids'll send her down memory lane
You know that one auntie, you don't wanna be rude
But every holiday nobody eatin' her food
And you don't wanna stay there cuz them your worst cousins
Got roaches at their crib like them your first cousins
Act like you ain't took a bath with your cousins
Fit three in the bed while six of y'all
I'm talkin' 'bout three by the head and three by the leg
But you ain't have to tell my girl I used to pee in the bed

[Interlude: Choir]
Rain, rain, rain go away
Let the sun come out and all the children say
Rain, rain, rain go away
Let the sun come out and all the children say

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I woke up early this mornin' with a new state of mind
A creative way to rhyme without usin' knives and guns
Keep your nose out the sky, keep your heart to God
And keep your face to the risin' sun
All my niggas from the Chi, that's my family dog
And my niggas ain't my guys, they my family dog
I feel like one day you'll understand me dog
You can still love your man and be manly dog
You ain't got to get heated at every house warmin'
Sittin' here, grillin' people like George Foreman
Why Uncle Ray and Aunt Shiela always performin'?
The second he storm out then she storm in
Y'all gon' sit down, have a good time this reunion
And drink some wine like Communion
And act like everything fine and if it isn't
We ain't lettin' everybody in our family business

[Interlude: Choir]
(all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)
They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)
They don't mean a thing
(all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)
They don't mean a thing, a thing

[Hook: Choir]
And I don't care 'bout (all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)
They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)
All these fancy things
I tell you that all (all the glitter) I'm waiting for
Now all I know I know all these things

Females: (oooh) All these things (these things)
Males: All these things (oooh) all these things (these things)
F: All these things (oooh) all these things (these things)
M: All these things (oooh) all these things (these things)
F: All these things (oooh) all these things (these things)
M: All these things (oooh) all these things (these things)
F: All these things (oooh) all these things (these things)
M: All these things (oooh) all these things (these things)&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;[Intro: Jay-Z] + (Kanye)
*laughing*
Yo fuck you, Kanye, first and foremost
For making me do this shit. Muh'fucker
Had to throw everybody out the motherfucking room 
'Cause they don't fucking...

(I'd like to propose a toast)
(I said toast motherfucker)

[Chorus: Kanye]
And I am
And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them
Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky
This is the last call for alcohol, for the...
So get your ass up off the wall

[Verse 1]
The all around the world Digital Underground, Pac
The Rudloph the red nosed reindeer of the Roc
I take my chain, my 15 seconds of fame
And come back next year with the whole fucking game
Ain't nobody expect Kanye to end up on top
They expected that College Dropout to drop and then flop
Then maybe he stop savin' all the good beats for himself
Rocafella's only niggas that helped
My money was thinner than Sean Paul's goatee hair
Now Jean Paul Gaultier cologne fill the air, here
They say he bourgie, he big-headed
Won't you please stop talking about how my dick head is
Flow infectious, give me 10 seconds
I'll have a buzz bigger than insects in Texas
It's funny how wasn't nobody interested
'Til the night I almost killed myself in Lexus

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Now was Kanye the most overlooked? Yes sir
Now is Kanye the most overbooked? Tes sir
Though the fans want the feeling of A Tribe Called Quest
But all they got left is this guy called West
That'll take Freeway, throw him on tracks with Mos Def
Call him Kwa-li or Kwe-li, I put him on songs with Jay-Z
I'm the Gap like Banana Republic and Old Navy, and oooh
It come out sweeter than old Sadie
Nice as Bun-B when I met him at the Source awards
Girl he had with him - ass coulda won the horse awards
And I was almost famous, now everybody love Kanye, 
I'm almost Raymond
Some say he arrogant. Can y'all blame him?
It was straight embarrassing how y'all played him
Last year shoppin my demo, I was tryin' to shine
Every motherfucker told me that I couldn't rhyme
Now I could let these dream killers kill my self-esteem
Or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams
I use it as my gas, so they say that I'm gassed
But without it I'd be last, so I ought to laugh
So I don't listen to the suits behind the desk no more
You niggas wear suits 'cause you can't dress no more
You can't say shit to Kanye West no more
I rocked 20,000 people, I was just on tour, nigga
I'm Kan, the Louis Vuitton Don
Bought my mom a purse, now she Louis Vuitton Mom
I ain't play the hand I was dealt, I changed my cards
I prayed to the skies and I changed my stars
I went to the malls and I balled too hard
'Oh my god, is that a black card?'
I turned around and replied, why yes but I prefer the term
African American Express
Brains, power, and muscle, like Dame, Puffy, and Russell
Your boy back on his hustle, you know what I've been up to
Killin y'all niggas on that lyrical shit
Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push Miracle Whips

[Chorus]
&quot;... last call for alcohol, for my niggas&quot;

[Outro]
So this A&amp;R over at Rocafella, named Hiphop
picked the Truth beat for Beanie. And I was in the session with him
I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do
I play the songs, he's like &quot;Who that spittin?&quot; 
I'm like &quot;It's me.&quot; He's like &quot;Oh, well okay.&quot;
Uhh, he started talkin to me on the phone, going back and forth
just askin me to send him beats
And I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers
cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin with
And um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID
And No ID told him, &quot;Look man, you wanna mess with Kanye
you need to tell him that you like the way he rap&quot;
[No ID: &quot;Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap&quot;]
I was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not
but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer
[Hiphop: &quot;I'll sign you as a producer and a rapper&quot;], I'm like oh shit
I was messin with, uh, D-Dot also
People were like this, started talking about the ghost production
But that's how I got in the game
If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here
So you know, after they picked that Truth beat
I was figuring I was gonna do some more work
But shit just wasn't poppin off like that
I was stayin in Chicago, I had my own apartment
I be doin like, just beats for local acts
just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy
get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something
or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then
I made this one beat where I sped up this Hal Melville sample
I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, &quot;Oh, yo that shit is crazy.
Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin, called The Dynasty.&quot;
And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin right to me
so I went and um, I was listening to Dre &quot;Chronic 2001&quot; at that time
and really I just, like picked the drums off &quot;Xxplosive&quot; and put it like
with it sped up, sampled, and now it's kind of like my whole style
when it started, when he rapped on &quot;This Can't be Life.&quot;
And that was like, really the first beat of that kind
that was on the &quot;Dynasty&quot; album. I could say that was the
the resurgence of this whole sound
You know, I got to come in and track the beat
and at the time I was still with my other management
I really wanted to roll with Hiphop
Cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm sayin
cause I been there for a while, I appreciated what they did for me
but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change
try to move up to the next level. And that day I came and I tracked the beat
and I got to meet Jay-Z and he said, &quot;Oh you a real soulful dude&quot;
[Jay-Z: &quot;You a real soulful dude&quot;] And he, uh, played the song
cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio
You know how he do it, one take. And he said,
[Jay-Z: &quot;Check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here&quot;] 
&quot;Tell me what you think of this.&quot; And I heard it, and I was thinking like
Man, I really wanted more like of the simple type Jay-Z
I ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the
in my personal opinion. So he asked me, &quot;What you think of it?&quot; 
[Jay-Z: &quot;so what you thinkin?&quot;] And I was like, &quot;Man that shit tight,&quot;
you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train, 
man, you know. So after that I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just
in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got
acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin really like
poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homeys that was one
of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through
my production company, but he ended up going straight with the
company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad
news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at
the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took
that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about
ten days before I had to actually get out. So I ain't have to deal
with the landlord 'cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to
[Mother: &quot;Come on, let's just go&quot;] Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even
seen my apartment. I remember I pulled up [Mother: &quot;Kanye, baby, we're
here&quot;], I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a
bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and
the first beat I made was, uh, 'Heart of the City.'
And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up
there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I
played like seven beats. And, you know I could see he's in the zone,
he already had the beats that he wanted, I did nothing like already at
that time. But then Jay walked in. I remember he had a Gucci bucket
hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hiphop said,
&quot;yo play that one beat for him.&quot; And I played 'Heart of the City.' And
really I made 'Heart of the City,' I really wanted to give that beat
to DMX. [Hiphop: &quot;No I think Jay gon' like this one right here&quot;]. And
I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that
Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of
them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen
Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, 
&quot;yo what's up I'm Kanye.&quot; [Dame: &quot;Yo, you that kid, Kanye?&quot;] 
&quot;You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got
classics&quot; [Dame: &quot;Jay got classics, G.&quot;]. You know I ain't talkin
shit. I'm like &quot;oh shit.&quot; And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm
still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show,
The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin, these were superstars in my
eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all
these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one
thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be
Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton
sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hiphop was there, I think Tata, John
Minnelli, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the
time they was in the room, and I said, &quot;yo Jay I could rap.&quot; And I
spit this rap that said, uh &quot;I'm killin y'all niggas on that lyrical
shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips.&quot; And I saw his
eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the West, the rap
was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response. He said &quot;man,
that was tite.&quot; [Jay-Z: &quot;That, that was cool. That was hot.&quot;]. That
was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe. Okay, fast
forward. So, Blueprint, H to the Izzo, my first hit single. And I just
took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship
with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my
career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course later he allowed me
to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at
this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had
relationships with all these A&amp;R's, and they wanted beats from me, so
they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. &quot;Gimme a beat that sound
like Jay-Z.&quot; You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them
these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll
be like, &quot;yo but I rap too.&quot; Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy
'cause you know, 'cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever.
Everybody out there listen here. I played them 'Jesus Walks' and they
didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&amp;R's that fucked
with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the
company that'll say &quot;naw.&quot; Like, Dave Lotti fucked with me, my
nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man.
[Jessica: &quot;Man, you niggas is stupid if y'all don't sign Kanye, for
real.&quot;]. I'm not gonna say nothin to mess my promotion up [&quot;Y'all
niggas is stupid&quot;]. Let's just say I didn't get my deal. The nigga
that was behind me, I mean, he wasn't even a nigga, you know? The
person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol
Records. He wanted to sign me really bad. [Joe: &quot;We gonna change the
game, buddy.&quot;]. Dame was like, &quot;yo you got a deal with Capitol, okay
man, just make sure it's not wack.&quot; [Dame: &quot;you gotta make sure it's
not wack.&quot;]. Then one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to
play some songs, 'cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and
Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll
never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'
&quot;I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow.
 I got eleven plaques on my walls right now.
 You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow.&quot;
Like the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So
I play that song for him, and he's like &quot;oh shit&quot; [Dame: &quot;Oh shit,
it's not even wack.&quot;] &quot;I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot.&quot; [Dame:
&quot;it's actually kinda hot.&quot;]. Like they still weren't looking at me
like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'like man. If he do a whole
album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and
save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's
like &quot;yo man, we, we on a brick, we on a brick&quot; [Dame: &quot;you don't
wanna catch a brick&quot;]. You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained
on. I told Hiphop and Hiphop was all, &quot;oh, word?&quot; Actually, even with
that I was still about to take the deal with Capitol 'cause it was
already on the table and 'cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you
know, 'cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I
was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm
not gonna name no names, but people told me, &quot;oh he's just a producer
rapper&quot; and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right-- 
the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do,
man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio
sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes,
man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said,
&quot;yo... Capitol pulled on the deal&quot; [Mel: &quot;Yo, Capitol pulled out on
the deal.&quot;]. And, you know I told them that Rocafella was interested,
and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying
to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I
called G, I said, &quot;man, you think we could still get that deal with Rocafella?&quot;&lt;/lyrics&gt;

There is an imposter among us.

Pretending he's broke walking amongst us.
This brother has been eating every day, can you believe that? Eating every day.
Pretending he's with us, he's not one of us.
I did not want to believe this, but I walked into the brother Kanye's closet and I found new shoes.
I found new shoes!
Kanye, would you like to step forward and explain these new shoes?!

[Kanye: (stammering)] I was-you crazy, I wasn't, I didn't, um, I was just um, I was-

[Kanye:] I was gon' stick-I'm tryin to stick to my roots and-

[Leader:] What?

[Kanye:] I wanna stick to my roots, and-

[Leader:] What?! You march your new shoes out of here, Kanye.
Don't you ever come back in 'em. Don't you ever come back smellin' all good, taking showers and shit like
That, all right? We don't appreciate that down here at Broke Phi Broke.

What's next?&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;This was founded years ago
By broke slaves, years ago
Who did not have, years ago
By broke brothas in the 20s, years ago
Who did not have when we could not eat 
Hmm, remember that?
Eating all of our cereal with forks because we wanted to save the milk, do you remember that? Hmm?
Do you remember all those Christmas' when your Mama walked in the room and pretended she was the tree, huh?
Remember that?&lt;/lyrics&gt;

No, we have no money 
We are sharin' jeans.
If I go outside, I got the only clothing on.
How many cars do we own? (None!)
How many cars do we own? (None, sir!)
Should we let our woman go and be with the cat in the car?
Yes, we will.
Why? Because we can't afford gas. Say it with me!
(We can't afford no gas!)
Say it!
(We can't afford no gas!)
So we ain't drivin'!&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;[Kanye West]
Heavy hitters fo' life, heavy hitters fo' life

You rappers think I give a fuck about the way that they spit
Wanna be on my album but don't want me on they shit
Everybody thought I was makin' a compilation
I was really makin' myself, they competition
Fresh off the plane from the All-Star game
??? on TV so it's All-Star trains
Just picture man, no snitchin' man
Somethin' for the fiends fresh out the kitchen man
Last 9.11 I was poor on the ave
'Til I pulled out my map
Not it's course 9.11 and I'm floorin' the gas
Gotta lotta problems, but at least one that Annette have no more
Uh, well Dame look at how everybody changed
   Tell Jay that I'm 'bout to change the game
Tell B.I.G. that we about to get paid
   All my niggaz about to have it made
This makes everything else sound played
   Goddamn Kanye (Kanye) Kanye!
Now hold up
Ain't nobody messin' with me dog
Now you say it (ain't nobody messin' with you at all)
I told dude &quot;You can't even rap on my interlude&quot;
Now does that make me as rude as you?
(When the album comin' out?) Man the peoples is askin'
Y'all don't model Adidas, just stick with the fashion
Y'all already got do' so just spit for the passion
The way ya rhyme give me Tribe Called Quest flashbacks
And let's not even bring up the tracks man
Nope, nope, let's not do that man
You eatin' up the game like Pac-Man
He got the whole world shakin' just like crack fangs

[Hook: Kanye West]
Heavy hitters fo' life, Roc-a-Fella is fo' life
Throw your diamonds up, throw your diamonds up
Throw your diamonds
Let the beat ride out for a minute

[GLC (Kanye West)]
Let's take it there, take it there man
It's not supposed to be ???
???
(GLC where you at nigga?)

How many niggaz you know put their life on the line and get signed
Did a few high crimes, almost got lifetime
After the sunshine you thinkin' it might count
How could I mic out, just look at my account
I used to work at the mall with nothin' at all
Seein' niggaz that ball, that shit was depressin'
Keep my clothes in the cleaners, I hate with the pressin'
When I copied hounds it was my best investment
Dre got shot and it taught me a lesson
I'm stickin' niggaz up and them rubbery masses
Mash like Batman minus the tight pants
Would hit your baby momma but her elbows is ashy
Fo' different blues, man your outfit is crashin'
You ain't got no muscles dude you weakling bastard
Man look at your haircut
Mm hmm, mm hmm, NAW, your hair sucks
How many niggaz you know is really heavy hitters
'87 go getters, two hoes like John Ritter
Even did it on his crime picture and ye
And offers to sell and yell, uh

[Hook: Kanye West]
Heavy hitters fo' life, Roc-a-Fella is fo' life
Throw your diamonds up, throw your diamonds up
Throw your diamonds&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;WHOO!

[Hook]
Memph' Bleek always smokin that la-la-la (HOO)
Beanie Sigel always smokin that la-la-la (HOO)
Kanye track smoke like la-la-la (HOO)
It's the R.O.C. mami, sing our lullaby
C'mon!

[Chorus]
Excuse me miss, I'm the shit
You should come, hang with me, basically
Hold up, skip all the singin' let's get right tonight mami

[Jay-Z]
I know my English ain't as modest as you like
But come, get some, you little bums
I take the cake from under the baker's thumbs
I bake the cake, get two of them for one
Then I move the weight like I'm Oprah's son
Uh, I'll show you how to do this son
Young don't mess with chicks in Burberry paddings
Fake Manolo boots straight from Steve Madden (u-uh)
He padded hisself the rap J.F.K., you wanna pass for my Jaqueline Onassis
Then, hop ya ass out that S-class
Lay back in that Maybach, roll the best grass, I ask
Have you in your long-legged life
ever seen a watch surrounded by this much pink ice?
Look but don't touch, motherfucker think twice
'Cause the gat that I clutch got a little red light
Need a light?

[Hook]
To smoke that la-la-la
Beanie Sigel always smoking that la-la-la
Memph' Bleek always smoking that la-la-la
It's the R.O.C. mami, sing our lullaby
C'mon!

[Chorus]
Excuse me miss, I'm the shit
You should come, hang with me, basically
Hold up, skip all the singin' let's get right tonight mami

[Jay-Z]
We got brothers full of Arm'i, mami's in Manolo
Bags by Chanel, all Louis Vuitton logos
All attracted to Hov' because they know dough
When they see him, whips be European
If you're a ten, chances you're with him
If you're a five, you know you ridin' with them
Sick with the pen nigga, no physician in the world could fix him
No prescription, you could prescribe to subside, his affliction
He's not a sane man, he's more like reign man - twitchin'
You can't rain dance on his picnic
No Haitian voodoo, no headless chickens can dead his sickness
No Ouija board, you can't see me dog, nigga you CB-4
This ain't Chris Rock bitch, it's the R.O.C. bitch
And I'm the franchise like a Houston Rocket, Yao Ming!

[Hook]
Still smokin that la-la-la
Memph' Bleek still smokin that la-la-la
Beanie Sigel, Desert Eagle, the four-ty five
It's the R.O.C. baby, sing our lullaby
C'mon!

[Chorus]
Excuse me miss, I'm the shit
You should come, hang with me, basically
Hold up, skip all the singin' let's get right tonight mami

[Verse Three: Kanye West]
She playin she hate when I'm name droppin
So when I talk rap, she gon' change topics
But I got a plan B that's planned out, for when things don't pan out
Hov' tellin ya mind brother, I'ma play shy brother
So you take the Destiny Child girl in the Coupe?
Then I'ma try bag the ones that got kicked out the group
I figured that'll be simple, I'll just help 'em with their demo
Help 'em to the limo, play the upboard instrumentals
And she - grabbed my tattoo, peeped my credentials
And she - grabbed my pants, felt the potential
And I - rubbed 'bout every essential
That have fun breakin her fundamentals
Excuse me miss, the artist of the new millenium
Has finally stopped drivin that blue Millenium
And got a good of trenny and filled it with plenty of Henney
and Remi and weed, 'til she higher than Hilliam

[Hook]
If she pass me, smoke that la-la-la
Memphis Bleek always smokin that la-la-la
Beanie Sigel, Desert Eagle, the four-ty five
It's the R.O.C. bitch, sing our lullaby
C'mon!

[Chorus]
Excuse me miss, I'm the shit
You should come, hang with me, basically
WHOA, skip all the singin' let's get right tonight, mami&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;[Mos Def]
History
It's happenin' every day y'all (right now)
Everyday (right now)
Right now (good mornin', Vietnam!)
Listen
Brooklyn wins again
It's the Stuy, it's the Bush, dem niggaz again
Ta' Kweli, Mighty Def, and S. Dot on the guest lock
Kanye, you're the dope man in hip hop, now let's rock
Now roll out niggaz, my hometown niggaz
I get it good in your hood so slow down niggaz
Watch the speed though, man, you better let ease off
A street talk into a collision course with these walls - bam!
They don't move, don't pray, don't lose, don't sleep
Life passin', light flasin', life happens that fast part a gun
Black hands up in prayer
Black guns up in fear
Dyin' wish is to touch the air
Seekin' heaven that wasn't here
Eyes will not see another year
It's another day
It's the same fight
Different round, sound the bell
Mix it up in victory where you live it up the beat
And get risen up you're knocked down get it back and get it up
Get off of queer street and get with us
And get clear where we did it
From the heart, from the people
From the top, from the jeep
From the gut, from the street
From my soul to the mic to the essence
Say in my absence you feel the presence, exactly
I make contact for short, I, MC
Me and mine we don't just get by
We get free and that's ready [Mos -- nigga]

[Jay-Z]
Just to get by
Nigga I sold coke, nigga I pushed lah
Carried a fo'five
Claimed I was ready to die
Promised never to cry
Held it all inside
Reality was too much to take so I
Kept my mind fried
Slept for most of mine
Soon as I closed my eyes
Then I woke up behind
Thinkin' either I load up these nines
Or blow up with rhymes
'Cause this flow of mine is like blow up but lines of coca
And your folks think Hov' just wrote stuff to rhyme
Nah, I'm a poster for what happened seein your moms
Doin five dollars worth to work just to get a dime
So pardon my disposition
Why should I listen to a system that never listened to me?
Picture me working McDonald's
I'd rather pull a mac on you
Sorry Ms. Jackson but I'm packin

[Kanye West]
It's on I'm packin' weight like nina simone  Piano flow 
It's like a Michaelangelo painted a portrait of Maya Angelou
And gave it to a sick poet for they antidote
If music get's you choked up this is the tree and a rope
This is Chi nigga, I'm mista all-a-dat
Fuck a map, let's put this bitch on the almanac
Dice what they hittin' for, 'lax what you sittin' on
Tracks who you spittin on, rap till we get it on
And don't let nobody with the power to sign
Ever tell you you ain't got the power to rhyme
They used to tell me toughen up
Put some bass in your voice
They used to tell me lighten up
Put some mase in your voice
Lord willin' I ain't kill nobody
But I have a feelin' this album
That I'm gonna make a killin'
Or not a shillin'
This is love it or hate it music
But, at least we made it music
And we didn't make it industry
This is gon' be interesting
This'll be the end of me or I'm fittin' to be an entity
Kanye, Jay-Z, Mos Def, and Kweli
We are not makin' songs no more
We're makin' history

[background singers]
This morning I woke up
Feelin brand new, I jumped up
Feelin my highs and my lows
In my soul, and my goals
Just to stop smoking and stop drinkin
But I been thinkin I got my reasons
Just to get (by), just to get (by)
Just to get (by), just to get (by)

[background singers repeat in the background]
bah dah bah dah, bah dah bah dah
bah dah bah dah, bah dah bah daaah

[Talib Kweli]
Just to get by, just to get by
Just to get by, just to get by

[background singers]
bah dah bah dah, bah dah bah dah
Bah dah bah dah, bah dah bah daaah

[Talib Kweli]
Just to get by, just to get by
Just to get by

We keep it gangsta, stay 'fo shizzle', 'fo sheezy'
To set the tide to the violence on the TV during the war
Killin each other is easy, there's war and liquor for fallen niggaz Believe
me, it's ghetto love, I bet you seen it all befo'
Just to get by, my people we get fly
My people we get high, fillin cigars with the lah
Nigga come on, even Jesus was stoned before receivin' the throne
I said to rest in peace to Nina Simone

[Busta Rhymes]
Back in the days we was used to doin the shit
I can't call it all in the streets
We was hustlin fiends that asked for it
I guess I was used to just standin on corners
Waitin for paper bags with bundles of crack
Hopin the week was good so I could get money back
To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
When I was stressed I possessed a side of my strength
That made me angry and bleed
With the frustration havin me smokin Newports and weed
To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
Those be the times when I try to rely
On my niggaz and street motherfuckers
And reach out to wifey and then I place a call on my mother
To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
(Hey yo mom pick up the phone, I g- I gotta to talk to you ma)
If you was five percent instead of actin stupid and guessin
You had to go and study your lessons
And know your math in the building in session

[Hook: Talib Kweli + background singers]
This morning I woke up
Feelin brand new, I jumped up
Feelin my highs and my lows
In my soul, and my goals
Just to stop smoking and stop drinkin
But I been thinkin I got my reasons
Just to get (by), just to get (by)
Just to get (by), just to get (get buh buh buh bye bye)

[background singers repeat in the background]
bah dah bah dah, bah dah bah dah
bah dah bah dah, bah dah bah daaah

[Talib Kweli]
Some people try
Some people try just to get by
For my piece of the pie
You love to eat and be high
We deceive and we lie
And we keepin' it fly - yo yo yo yo yo
People ???
Keeper of the skies
Can't see your eyes
See the evil inside
The best people you find
Stronger people in mind
I stay readin' the signs
yo-yo-yo-yo yo
[repeat]&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;[Murphy Lee]
Whooooooooooo, what up derrty?
Damn, that girl fine, that girl fine, that girl fine
Yo, yo, Kanye, yo turn it up, a little bit, whoo

[Hook]
Take notes while I take tokes to the marijuana smoke
One look and murder she wrote
She drop dead gorgeous, she drop dead..

[Kanye West {*over the hook*}]
Yo, this is a Roc-a-Fella, St. Lunatics collaboration
Chi-Town and St. Louis
She said she ain't never seen Murphy Lee befo'

[Murphy Lee]
I called her back from an earlier beep
Fo' in the mornin' they be like &quot;Nah, I wasn't sleep&quot;
Convenient whore stay on top of convenient stores
Keep pictures of me in their Victoria Secret drawer
I keep somethin' hot on tour
Can ya, Kenyatta, make sure they know before what is really in store
See I adore the ones that call me Tory, true story
I created 'hood rats so these new mice bore me
See I normally settle for sevens, but eights I can't wait
Nines be wantin' time and dimes be wantin' dates
So know I got elevens and twelves
With at least thirteen or fourteen reasons why they fine as hell
I hit 'em up like Blu Cantrell
Hehehehehehehehe hell, I remember when she smashed LaBelle
See most women kinda sneaky like a six-year old
Hey yo they always in the summer, somethin' wrong with their nails

[Hook]
Take notes while I take tokes to the marijuana smoke
One look and murder she wrote
She drop dead gorgeous, she drop dead..

[Kanye West]
What's the point of havin' a girl that's drop dead
That you know don't like you?
She'll run over your head with a motorcycle
I mean the way you look is nice, but there's more to life boo
Cuz I could go to videos and get fo' just like you
I talked to your ex-boyfriend and took a census
But you don't read the cookbook, you just look at the pictures
Matter of fact, when's the last time you looked at the kitchen?
This is gettin' ridiculous, how you gettin' offensive?
Jimmy too, Frankie B., bitch you gettin' expensive
I know you fuckin' around, my sixth sense told me
That ain't no male friend that bought you the stereo
She said &quot;He gay anyway, you don't know nothin' about Jamario&quot;

[Hook]
Take notes while I take tokes to the marijuana smoke
One look and murder she wrote
She drop dead gorgeous, she drop dead..&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;[Chorus: Twista]
And we gone stay hustling on the block until we caught
And we gone stay showing off that jewelry that we bought
And we gone stay heated in case it's in and out of court
'Cause we some gangstas, I don't know what the fuck you thought

[Verse One: Ludacris]
Sometimes I think that I gotta see a little bit of brighter days
'Cause I confine myself to a city near you in a solid cage
And you could look to the left and the right, but I'm trapped on center stage
And I could rap to the beat, but I don't know how to change my wage
I still hear a pull and I track 'em, and strack 'em, and whack 'em
Jack a nigga for the day to days and I yak 'em, attack 'em, and sack 'em
Get a weapon and I crack his brain 'cause I'm hustler, baller, pro
And it wouldn't be right for me to be around busters, and crawlers, and hoes
But I'm a pimp at night so talk shit and I'm gonna lift 'em up off of their toes
With a street sweeper regulating quarters, and ki's, and o's
In the two seater, Ludacris and Twista with bags of 'dro
Smoking and choking, get 'em up and croaking
It's so potent, I'm hoping to keep on floating
Soaking wet and you can bet, people I'm high
I'm seeing lions, and tigers and bears - oh my!
And I can't hide it and keep it hidden, good riddance of feeling good
I'm weapon-concealing, stealing my neighborhood
Would, could, and should break a nigga off
They'll see you later, go to the doctor, hold my balls and (cough)
Because the vapors and I caught the drawn, brain blown, honey I'm home
Give me the microphone, and fools is like, &quot;leave me alone!&quot;

[Chorus]

[Verse Two: Twista]
Throw it up if you get high, get blowed, get drunk
If you on what I'm on come on and kick it, let's ride, smoke 'dro, beat the trunk
All the bad ass bitches that want to party, just shake it, great players get pumped
Me and my thugs and hustlers in the party, get money, fuck hoes, get crunk
(Look out) Put a little bit of hash and some motherfucking purple haze
I feel it all over my body, adrenaline with the Bacardi
got me up and then ripping shit in a rage
In the netti confetti with a belly, gucci
Timberland stepping on the pedal up in the 'lac truck
Want to get me for the wood
Better get the whole motherfucking 'hood to come and give you some back up
We can get into it and if you want to do it
I'm leaking the fluids out of the bodies that want to come at this
If they ever got some blood for fucking with thugs that I bury
My adversaries better not want none of Twis'
Represent for the city, anybody that different with me
got into thinking its a game
And whether you in my city and I talk shit
I'm going to kill him, especially if he say my name
I've been known to handle my business
Or I'm gonna stick him up for the scrilla, from K-Tilla, smoking on a fat pilla
Murder haters that I'm full of
Niggaz claiming they wanna bring a baretta they'll be killas
Balling out so hard the size of my rims grows to a hellafied sight-scene
When the dough become no bigger, I'm gonna still drop that 2003
(Throw it up if you...)

[Chorus] - 2X&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;[Chorus: Jazze Pha]
(Badunkadunk) All in your face when you're at the club
(Badunkadunk) Slide down the poll for the 30 Dub
(Badunkadunk) Look at your ass girl, it's so much fun
(Badunkadunk) I tell the DJ, I mean ya #1
(Badunkadunk) What? (Badunkadunk) Rock Yo!
(Badunkadunk) All That (Badunkadunk) Bounce Yo!
(Badunkadunk) Big Phat (Badunkadunk) I Love Yo!
(Badunkadunk) Tell the DJ, I mean I'm #1

[Verse 1: Twista]
Ooh! Shit, damn shawty look at the muthafuckin' fatty
Come to daddy, tell me what I gotta do to get you lickin' in my custom caddy
Never wanna let you get up out the ride
When I burst to the lip my mouth is wide
Look at titties with them little bitty shorts you got on
With the thighs hangin' out the side
When you work it you gone hurt these other bitches(That's Right)
Hurtin' em' mean with the way you struttin'
Even though you only walkin'
You still lookin' like you shouldn't do that shit in public
I can tell from right now what I see you workin' with
You ain't even gotta ask for the blunt
Booty so phat, gaps so nice, you can see ya ass from the front
You finna hurt how you twurk that thang
You want me to hear when you pop it baby
Fell in love when you came up in club, with a whole bottle of Mo'
Don't pop it baby!
I know you got up on some rump shaker time
Just let us see what you can do
Sip a little something while you bounce that ass
Girl you gotta Badunkadunk

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Twista]
Now bounce that ass, hurry up for the Bentley
Now gone drop that bikini for the Lamborghini
Now let me see you in a car for the big grown
Love the way you shake it for the dollar
Holla at me when you see me
Now I don't wanna see nobody full of rigimortis
Go head and jiggle for the more more money that's in his hands
Go head and hit the shades with ya thick ass
Now come over here by the table and give me a lap dance
Bend it over come and get this dust
Come take it off now we in the cut
Gots to hit that from the back
Shorty gotta lil junk in her trunk
Look at how she make one butt-cheek freeze
Look at how she make the other cheek move fast
Look at how she switch, make the other cheek move
Then move both sides then clap that ass
Remember them times!, when you met two shawty's
And you really want the cutest
But you let her slide, cuz the other gotta really big-o donkey booty
Now shawty think she fine, only if she really knew the truth
I ain't gone lie, girl twurk them thighs
I'm in love with your big Badunkadunk

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Twista]
Can you make it go wobbley-wobbley, come on and follow me
Take you on a ride on the 'C' and umm!
If you let it jiggley-jiggley, make it go wiggley
Baby you can never get rid of me and umm!
Twurk something, ooh yeah
Yeah that booty softer then a teddy bear
So phat I can barely stare, with a darier, that's scary there
Come and drop for a nigga named Twista
Come and pop for me like a pistol
Got Badunkadunk's from a MOB and got Badunkadunk's for Jazze Phizzle
Girl you deserve respect, you look so good girl I commit you
The hottest thang on the menu
When I'm off up in the strip club, I like to get you
Twurk that thang, bounce that ass
Work it all the way down to the floor
Climb to the top, shake it up-side down
Side of the muthafuckin floor
Work that crown, give a lap-dance
Shake it like it's for lady-groups
Take all the ballers to the V.I.P
Girl gone work yo Badunkadunk

[Chorus]

Shake That Thang Girl!(Repeat to the end of song)
[Jazze Pha]
This! is a Jazze Phizzle Product-shizzle
My Nizzle! Hah!
Twista!, Chi-Town, Yeah
What? Legit Ballin' Daddy!
Ooh!, We out Daddy!&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;[Intro: woman (Kanye West)]
(first of all, this song right here got...)
You say what is it that you want?
(...a long ass intro)
You got everything that a woman could ever need in life
(you got everything)
You got a closet full of minks, Chinchilla
(you got beats from Kanye)
I got a bureau full of diamonds
(what else ya need?)
I can change four times a day if I want to
You even tryin' to eat lobster and drink champagne
Now you know that ain't your roots
For you strictly a collard green and cornbread bit
Now you know if anybody know it I know
But since you feel like that this evening
Sit down (know what?) and drink some champagne with me

And let me rap to you

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
You'll never catch me in that baby momma Benz again
I'm pushin' a G5
All the girls sayin' that his hair look Indian
And ain't never seen him and MCM
Now I don't like fake boobies but I'd do it to Lil'
Kim (yes I would)
We gon' roll this weed
We gon' play like Sonny Bono and hit these trees soon as we get alone
I'm doin' these beats for pro bono soon as we get to bone
Now she like a lotta clothes, I like to see her out of 'em
She got a lot exposed, pump up the volume
Pump up the volume, dance, dance
Don't give Kanye a chance
Cuz I'm a Gemini with two sides and two rides
Y'all talkin' business, I'm peepin' her thighs
Look, I'm tryin' to hit that back end 'fore I get that back in
Called Trina and &quot;Do she need that beat tracked again?&quot;

[Hook: Kanye West]
Cuz I came back for you
To show you that I'm workin' with a little somethin'
And we get the session pumpin'
See I came back for you
Cuz any rap chick that look half nice
I'm givin' 'em half price

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Back when Eve went with Steve before she had her weave
I was sendin' beat tapes like you wouldn't believe
Back when Foxy had a group with Nas and AZ
The way she looked on &quot;Chyna Doll&quot;, I woulda did them beats for free
Cuz only recently I been gettin' a decent fee
The checks I got from D Dot was just teasin' me
I bought somw earrings like Baby that may be fake
But at least it got girls callin' me 'Babycakes'
Now maybe Kay can hit 'em or Nas with Lazy K
And lady may, maybe hey
You're lookin' all thick and sweet
You need a nigga that can give you dick and beats
So go and get Angie and tell her

[Hook: Kanye West]
I came back for you
To show you that I'm workin' with a little somethin'
And we get the session pumpin'
See I came back for you
Cuz any rap chick that look half nice
I'm givin' 'em half price

[Outro: Kanye]
Got a two for head sale
Send, send headshots first though
Will you beat tapes for who? Oh Trina?
Oh I'm be right there, I'm right there
I'll be the- I'll be in studio in five minutes
Yo yo, she said she want her ass look gushy wet
I told her all I need is my back end check
I told her to-
I ain't feelin' that verse&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;You got to

[Chorus]
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down
All day long man, we back in town

[Consequence]
Homie check it out I got her mesmerized
So won't you hook a chew scorns, she tellin you buy
Street poetry is how ya boy get paid
And I wear no Escalade, metallic, black or beige
Yo when I walk up in the club you know I do not pay
Aiiyo my man Kanyeezy he got something to say

[Kanye West]
Aiiyo my name is Kanyeezy from the Roc-A fam
And where the glocks don't jam, so where we pop them scrams
See I showed you on the champions how we get down
So don't twist ya lips, I'm like Bobby Brown
You got B2K on all your bedroom wall
But if you be with Kan, gonna work ya walls
Straight from the South side of dem Chi-town streets
The top three in the game, with these here beats

[Consequence]
And if you talk about him, aiiyo I take you out
Either with the nine or the tech's in his mouth
And let that dime gettin friendly than the orgie's at eight
But y'all niggaz don't shine so you couldn't relate

[Chorus]
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down (You couldn't relate)
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down (Yo Quence, you couldn't relate)
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down

[Consequence]
Quence without the game, now he's back to ball
Drive you insane, drop a tat at the mall
You starin at my Rolls' cold way to long
But I ain't scared of robbers, why I wear tephlon
I took her on the ave and she expect me to trip
But I made up with no style while I bought me some kicks
So if you want the drama holler at ya boy

[Kanye West]
Original rude boy like Pastor Troy
The G-500 is my favorite toy
'Cause it don't look like a thug or a hood
But he keep dem gorilla's so we still be good
By the way my name is K, don't forget the A
and the N-Y-E, out N.Y.C
I'ma still rep the gold, no matter where I go
Everybody say I'm hot, I'm sayin I'm cold
Hate when niggaz leave the city and switch up they reps
On the real homie, I don't get down like that
I'ma milk the game, 'til we all can eat

[Consequence]
Now the Chocolate Factory is what I bump in my jeep
So roll me up a L, but don't lace it with leak
'Cause that shit'll have me zonin for a couple of weeks

[Kanye West]
Now your momma told you let the Cleveland show
'Cause that's the best way to get a nigga with dough
They're fakin pregnancies and Cartier tournier
But she ain't know I'm cheaper than IKEA furniture

[Consequence]
Kanye, White, Malik, Little and D
Menace, Skates to Lou and 'em Puffs from L.B
They know the Consequence be wearin gold and ice
'Cause I got out the projects, where it's flooded with mice
Ey shorty let me tell you 'bout the rules of my Nikes
It seems they always keep on movin, I don't hear nuthin twice

[Chorus]
So relax yourself or we'll whack ya down  (Don't hear nuthin twice)
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down (Don't hear nuthin twice)
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down (Calm down)
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down (Yeah!)
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down (Yeah!)
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down (It's the R.O.C.!)
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down (Uhh)
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down (Yeah)
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down (Uh-huh, yeah)
All day long man, we back in town

[Repeat 'til end]
Relax yaself or we'll whack ya down&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;[Kanye West]
There's only one girl on my agenda
(You talking bout Brenda?)
Naw I'm talking bout Linda, from last September
Now Linda love lace like Linda love lace
LaFace says she like +Mase+ but she love +Face+
And I know that Linda was a hip-hop-head
And I know that Linda gave Hip-Hop head
But I feel I could convert her
Cuz I ain't here to hurt her mayn
And she was messin wit me when I was still at Burger King
She ain't hop in my bed cuz of the whips and cream
Cuz when I had her in bed I had whip cream
Shakespearian midsummer night dream
I unzip things and pull out big things
They was flashin gr-green, she was like &quot;ch-ching&quot;
Got em, but she know a rreeal nigga when she, spot him
So now she's pickin dresses from Veroraiyn
Scratchin out her maiden and here's my name
Now I'm sittin at the bar wit all my guys
They sayin &quot;Cheers to you for your future years of pain&quot;
Like &quot;Dog you ready to give all this shit up?
The summer's on its way and these hoes doin sit-ups
And when they see the way the G-5 lights lit up
Your gonna wanna have two like John Ritter&quot;
But naww, I bought her a brand new BM
He said &quot;Dog, slow down like Brand Nubian now&quot;

[Consequence]
I just feel the need to purge my soul from the work load
Couldn't watch another nigga get burnt slow
She said her man was busy, always bored her with work load
Never takes her out and falls asleep in his work clothes
She needs some excitement, which leads to this indictment
Believe what you like kid, according to her
When we recorded with her, Linda changed her name to Nicky
Sang along to Darlin Nicky, co-star of my quickies
That foot is so pretty, but I'm sure you recognize
That bra holds titties, those are her titties
Solar's so pretty, but not to rub it in
But that white Russian did make her lonely like the wind
So the over right that's in, on the over night depends
If you take heed the game, and please keep ya name, word

[Kanye West]
Cuz she's just a playa playa
That's playin games wit me

[John Legend]
I can't see myself getting out the game, no time soon
Ooooh, as I continue as I, Ooooh, as I continue as I
Oooh, Oooh
Can't see myself getting out the game, no time soon
Ooooh, as I continue as I, Ooooh, as I continue as I
Oooh, Oooh&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;[Samuel Christian] 
You ready?

[Knoc-Turn'al]
Yes, ha ha ha
Yeah, yeah
Let's go, I like singing

[Knoc-Turn'al]
My music, my life, my heart, my soul
My music, my everything, I give my all
My wife, my daughter, my love, my dream
My mother, my father, my brother, my team
My camp, my squad, my house, my car
My boat, my shoes, my pants, my shirt
My coke, my sugar, my cream, my butter
My toast, my all, my queen, my folks

[Chorus: Samuel Christian]
My baby! Walk like six strings
Talk like she's my everything
My baby! Loves me, hates me
Leaves me, runs right back
That sexy lady! All I know
She shares all my confusion, so
My baby! Will not run from an-y-thing
I swear this though

[Knoc-Turn'al talking]
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
If Muzik should die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul to take

[Knoc-Turn'al]
She's thick, she's bad, so clean, she's fine
She loves, she hates, she laughs, she cries
She hurts, she lies, she's Bonnie, I'm Clyde
She's ghetto, she's real, she sings, she rhymes
She comes, she goes, she lives, she dies
She sexy and bomb, she blows my mind
She stays in line, she's smart, she's funny
She's crafty and cunning, in the game she's running
Her lips, her back, her waist, her thighs
Her face, her skin, her hair, her eyes
Her voice, her shape, her hips, her mind
Her love, her smile, her touch, her time

[Chorus]

[Knoc-Turn'al]
I'm tipsy, I'm through, I'm drunk, I'm blunted
My way, my day, my life - I love it
I move, I groove, I shake, I love it
My friends, my kins, I like, I love it
I show, I prove, I live, I learn
I show, I teach, I run these streets
My kin, my heart, my heat, my rhythm
My rap, my beat, my life, my head and my feet
My heart, my soul, my candy, my cake
My platinum, my gold, my land, my gate
My Benz, my lake
My keys, my money, my love, my hate 
My clothes, my phone, my house, my home
My money, my comb, my sugar, my spice
My base, my chrome
My rhythm, my music, my home
My world, my girl, my life, my home, my...

[Chorus] - repeat until fade&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;&quot;I'm not a one girl's guy... [real talk for ya, peep game]
And they know it, when it comes to love I don't lie [we don't lie man]
and the girls respect me for it [you gotta respect that]
Ain't gonna say my nose can't be open [I may never say never]
But right now it's just too many fine ladies out there
to choose one from [too many ladies, ha]
I'm tryin' girls out, just tryin' girls out

HOOK: I love girls, girls, girls, girls, girls I do adore
Yo put your number on this paper cuz I would love to date ya
Holla at ya when I come off tour

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Whoo! Who you lovin, who you wanna be huggin, heh
who you wit, who you wanna be fuckin
got this smarty art chick to whom I pose this question
I read a couple books to add to her soul's progression
to put this in laymen's term, I gave her some knowledge
she gave me, brains in return, she had to drop out of college
knowin she does this homework, I give her in house tutoring
in and out I'm movin through her student body union and
she, call me professor, say daddy come and test her
so she could fail on purpose and repeat the semester
I'm like, at this rate ma you never graduate
she said, I aint no fool I make it up in summer school

HOOK:
I love girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, I do adore
Yo put your number on this paper cuz I would love to date ya
Holla at ya when I come off tour
Now let the people sing
I'm tryin girls out, [just tryin girls out] just tryin girls out
Yo put your number on this paper cuz I would love to date ya
Holla at ya when I come off tour

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Heh, who you lovin, who you wanna be fuckin
who said what, why you trippin girl, why's you fussin?
got this model slash actress slash part time waitress
spend a whole day she hangin round with part time haters
all they do is diss dirt and put a up on my latest
itinerary, but since I tend to vary see
I tend to carry, more rumors than ten Mariah Careys
tend to hurries in ten places at once
plus she can't front just peep how I run mines
ma, our time together is our time together, and uh
our time apart is our time apart
so love Jay with your mind girl and not your heart
and some day I slow down, but for now I get around
like the late Makiavelli or Perelli twenty inches
or caine and O-dog, stick up tape from menace
you tell 'em chicks if they must know my buisness

HOOK:
I'm tryin girls out, just tryin girls out
put your number on this paper cuz I would love to date ya
holla at ya when I get off tour
I'm tryin girls, girls, girls, girls, girls I do adore
yo put your number on this paper cuz I would love to date ya
holla at ya when I come off tour

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Now even though I went to college and dropped out of school quick
I always had a P.H.D.--A pretty huge dick
Ladies tired of getting ripped off by guys like this
And giving head is like a whale that's using a toothpick
Well--I'm in the club for a limited time only
2 way or phone me if you tryna bone me
Yo man got moe-nee, you still feel lonely
Claim he love you, thats no doubt, this nigga's phony
You a light skinded Nia, a dark skinned Aaliyah
A Black Jennifer Lopez, a ghetto senorita
We can ride in my Jeep, but not no Kia
We can talk on my cell, but not Nokia
It be going in and out thats why I barely hear ya
I be goin' in and out just like a robberia
I'm tryna take this money like robbin Gia
Then i'mma take you to my house like Trick and Trina
Chi-Town, Chi-Town, big city of dreams
and my dick so big it can't fit in my jeans
And a bitch so mad she can't get in my cream
and it get so bad she wanna tear up my things
But still, K-A-N-Y-E
Chi-Town playa out in N-Y-C
She say she wanna go on a shopping spree
Bought her some cheap J.Lo jeans 'cuz the ass was free

&quot;I'm not a one girl's guy, and they know it
when it comes to love, I don't lie, and the girls respect me for it
aint gonna say my nose? can't be over
but right now it's just too many fine ladies out there to choose one from
I'm tryin girls out, waiting patiently
just tryin girls out, until I find the one for me&quot;&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;(Ad libs)
Yo Hip-Hop Is niggaz still talkin bout I can't rap Come On Now

Look for me Young K
Took Tupac beat and got paid
My favorite rapper is Makaveli, Nas and Jay-Z
Eminem, Mase, Biggie Smalls and me
Now if you was my girlfriend you don't need no guyfriend
He could get his head bust nigga ain't my friend
Why the hell you lying who the hell you trying
Who the hell you know that threw away his throwbacks
When they suggested they was made by Majestic
My answers cost three-hundred-fifty ya naw mean
Doesn't even have got her number we ain't on the same team
You got the hat the jacket shoelaces to match
I got the gat ratching new cases to catch
I got my business manager erasing my debt
I mean my credit was so pathetic I couldn't get a debit
I fill out for a car but shit they always debt it
My girl come over try to help me shine
How you gonna help me get a car your credit worser than mine
But everytime I get a check you be first up in line
Told you bout gold-diggin bitch it's worser than lying
You better grow up before I blow up
Have weed rolled up when I show up
Matter fact we broke as fuck
Ain't nothing left to do except get tore up from the floor up
Shit that's how I knew you was my girlfriend
So I promise to never pick up smutts
In my Cadillac pick-up truck
They need to get they sit-ups up
They always be colder than you
A little richer a little thicker a litter older than you
Probably a little smarter so they can drop me some jewels
That I could drop back to you to get your ass back in college
So you can be where they at two years from now
But for now bartender two beers for now
The second one is for my girlfriend

[Jay-Z] All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend me and my girlfriend
 [B.K.] Down to ride til the very end is me and my boyfriend me and my boyfriend

I'm talkin bout when we was in Nissan's no Benz or such
We wasn't from Switzerland but we'll still go Dutch
Greater man could prob picture like there go us
No styles just good times like they're so nuts
We always thought if we had dough we could do so much
Like you ain't got to save the roach we can finish the Dutch
Like we ain't have to go coach told you i'll be paid soon
We ain't got to sit in this emergency aisle just to get leg room
We ain't got to go back to my room there's only one bedroom
That I call my lair
We was V.I.P. Very Imaginary Playaz
But you was my girlfriend yea yea yea you was my girlfriend

[Jay-Z] Holla, All I need in this world of sin is me and my girlfriend me and my girlfriend
 [B.K.] Down to ride til the very end is me and my boyfriend me and my boyfriend

That's Right (Kanye)

[Jay-Z] All I need in this world of sin is me and my girlfriend me and my girlfriend
        Look for me
 [B.K.] Down to ride til the very end is me and my boyfriend me and my boyfriend
[Jay-Z] Yep!&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Baby, It's me... Maybe I bore you 
No, No it's my fault cause I can't afford you 
Maybe baby Puffy, Jay Z 
Could all be better for you 
Cause all I could do was love you 

Baby when I used to love you 
There's nuttin that I wouldn't do 
I'd twist through the fire for you 
Anything you asked me to 
But I'm tired of living this lie 
It's getting harder to justify 
I realize that I just don't love you 
Not like I used to 
Holla Holla Holla (yeaaahh) 
Holla holla holla (yeah, yeah, uh, uh) 

Maybe I should rob somebody 
So we could live like 
Whitney and Bobby 
It's probably my fault 
My bad, My loss 
You are the cause 
All I could do was love you 

Baby when i used to love you 
There's nothing that I wouldn't do 
I'd twist through the fire for you 
Anything you asked me to 
But I'm tired of living this lie 
It's getting harder to justify 
I realize that I just don't love you 
Not like I used to 
Holla Holla Holla (yeaaahh) 
Holla holla holla (yeah, yeah) 

Oh! I used to (wheeen I used to) 
Love you (used to... Love you) 
Oh! But I don't (baby no not any more... I don't love you) 
Love you (noooo, used to ... love you) 
Oh! I used to 
used to love you 

You're gonna miss me now... &lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;[Verse 1]
That's why alot of girls claim they aint into guys, and mess with other girls part time to improvise. 
I know she wouldn't buy that i'd seen it in her eyes, but i'm like any other guy; tryna get in her thighs, she tellin' me about how black people should enterprise, i'm like if you don't get your ass in this ride from enterprise, that i rented yesterday and gotta have in by 5, with the gas fully filled up like i didn't drive, 
i told her i had a girl dawg , fuck it , i didn't lie, i told her this rap game is alright, i'm just getting by, she had a lil' weed and we gotta lil high, and i'm looking at her eyes and i'm loving her vibe, told me back in '95 she fell in love with the tribe, boo back in '92 i was just like you, 
please don't be confused with the ice and jewels,i'm like any other nigga, buy ice to stay cool,like any other nigga that claim they hate school, and think&quot; she's banging but she's no ray choo!&quot; 

(Chorus)X2 

[Verse 2]
was there summit' i did wrong, yer i know i'm wrong, she's at home alone. and i'm allways gone, hate when she's made but more when she's passive, now she on the internet looking for classes, out of state tho, man that hurt yo,but i got work tho, but i'm at work yo, and she don't call alot and when she do she pouring out her heart, &quot;you never listen to me&quot; then the cord drop,umm, and i promised her everything , when i get a deal, imma get her a wedding ring, but when i got my deal i was back in the ring, fighting my urges, strip club slurges, i never had money, so i feel like a virgin, and i'm tryna break the banks cherry, tryna seek an for a canary, with a 'ferreri', a dinner date with halle berry, went from 50 g;s to 50 hundred in a week, now i'n tryna call, one ring, two ring, seven ring, eight ring, some mother pick up the phone. like she at school, and she don't stay here no more, i guess there must be more good women than men percentage wise, so a chance of having a husband just minimized, i guess that why she say she aint into guys, focus on school for a while to improvise. 

Chorus X2 
We ball till' we fall, 
Hit the mall, 
After weed, 'it' Don't call, 
He fill your life with nothing but lies, 
And i would like to apoligise. 

(drowning out) 
But if you can't stand right here and tell me everything gonna be alright, 
cos' untill your real man stands up i'm gonna have to improvise &lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;It's a kind of magic
It's a kind of magic
A kind of magic - no way
One dream, one soul, one prize
One goal, one golden glance of what should be
It's a kind of magic
One shaft of light that shows the way
No mortal man can win this day
It's a kind of magic
The bell that rings inside your mind
Is challenging the doors of time
It's a kind of magic
The waiting seems eternity
The day will dawn of sanity
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Is this a kind of magic?
It's a kind of magic
There can be only one
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be done
This flame that burns inside of me
I'm hearing secret harmonies
It's a kind of magic
The bell that rings inside your mind
Is challenging the doors of time
It's a kind of magic
It's a kind of magic
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be, will soon be, will soon be done
This is (this is) a kind (a kind) of magic (yeah)
There can be only one one one one
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be done - done
Magic - it's a kind of magic
It's a kind of magic
Magic magic magic (magic)
Ha ha ha haa - it's magic
Ha haa
Yeah yeah
Wooh
It's a kind of magic&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Um boom ba bay
Um boom ba bay
Um Um boom ba bay bay

Pressure pushing down on me
Pressing down on you no man ask for
Under pressure
That burns a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets

Um ba ba bay
Um ba ba bay
Dee day duh
Ee day duh

It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming get me out!
Tomorrow takes me higher
Pressure on people
People on streets

Day day day
Da da dup bup bup
Okay

Chippin' around
Kick my brains round the floor
These are the days
It never rains but it pours
Ee do bay bup
Ee do bay ba bup
Ee do bup
Bay bup
People on streets
Dee da dee da day
People on streets
Dee da dee da dee da dee da

It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming let me out!
Tomorrow takes me high high higher

Turned away from it all
Like the blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love
But it's so slashed and torn
Why why why?

(Love, love, love, love)

Insanity laughs under pressure we're cracking
Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love give love give love?
Give love give love give love give love give love give love?
Cause love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care
For the people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way
Of caring about ourselves
This is our last dance

This is our last dance
This is ourselves
Under Pressure
Under Pressure
Pressure&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Radio - radio
I'd sit alone and watch your light
My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know
I heard it on my radio

You gave them all those old time stars
Through wars of worlds - invaded by Mars
You made 'em laugh - you made 'em cry
You made us feel like we could fly
Radio

So don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio - radio

All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio blah blah
Radio what's new?
Radio, someone still loves you

We watch the shows - we watch the stars
On videos for hours and hours
We hardly need to use our ears
How music changes through the years

Let's hope you never leave old friend
Like all good things on you we depend
So stick around 'cos we might miss you
When we grow tired of all this visual
You had your time - you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio - radio

All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio blah blah
Radio what's new?
Someone still loves you

Radio ga ga (ga ga)
Radio ga ga (ga ga)
Radio ga ga (ga ga)

You had your time - you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio - radio&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I want it all
I want it all
I want it all... and I want it now!

Adventure seeker on an empty street
Just an alley creeper, light on his feet
A young fighter screaming, with no time for doubt
With the pain and anger can't see a way out
It ain't much I'm asking, I heard him say
Gotta find me a future move out of my way
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now

Listen all you people, come gather round
I gotta get me a game plan, gotta shake you to the ground
But just give me, huh, what I know is mine
People do you hear me, just gimme the sign
It ain't much I'm asking, if you want the truth
Here's to the future for the dreams of youth

I want it all (give it all - I want it all)
I want it all (yeah)
I want it all and I want it now

I want it all (yes I want it all)
I want it all hey
I want it all and I want it now

I'm a man with a one track mind
So much to do in one lifetime (people do you hear me)
Not a man for compromise and where's and why's and living lies
So I'm living it all, yes I'm living it all
And I'm giving it all, and I'm giving it all
Oooh oh yeah yeah - ha ha ha ha ha
Yeah yeah yeah yeaaah
I want it all

It ain't much I'm asking, if you want the truth
Here's to the future
Hear the cry of youth (hear the cry of youth) (hear the cry of youth)
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all and I want it now

I want it all yeah yeah yeaaaah
I want it all, I want it all and I want it now
Oh oh oh oh oooh

And I want it - now
I want it, I want it
Ooooh ha&lt;/lyrics&gt;

I want to break free
I want to break free from your lies
You're so self satisfied I don't need you
I've got to break free
God knows, God knows I want to break free

I've fallen in love
I've fallen in love for the first time
And this time I know it's for real
I've fallen in love, yeah
God knows, God knows I've fallen in love

It's strange but it's true
Hey, I can't get over the way you love me like you do
But I have to be sure
When I walk out that door
Oh how I want to be free, baby
Oh how I want to be free
Oh how I want to break free

But life still goes on
I can't get used to living without, living without
Living without you by my side
I don't want to live alone, hey
God knows, got to make it on my own
So baby can't you see
I've got to break free

I've got to break free
I want to break free, yeah
I want, I want, I want, I want to break free
Ooh yeah
I want to break - yeah eah&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;One two three four

Ooh ooh

While the sun hangs in the sky and the desert has sand
While the waves crash in the sea and meet the land
While there's a wind and the stars and the rainbow
Till the mountains crumble into the plain

Oh yes, we'll keep on trying
Tread that fine line
Oh, we'll keep on trying
Yeah
Just passing our time

Ooh ooh

While we live according to race, colour or creed
While we rule by blind madness and pure greed
Our lives dictated by tradition, superstition, false religion
Through the eons and on and on

Oh, yes, we'll keep on trying, yeah
We'll tread that fine line
Oh oh we'll keep on trying
Till the end of time
Till the end of time

Through the sorrow all through our splendour
Don't take offence at my innuendo

Duh duh duh duh duh duh duh
Duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh

You can be anything you want to be
Just turn yourself into anything you think that you could ever be
Be free with your tempo, be free, be free
Surrender your ego - be free, be free to yourself

Ooh ooh, yeah

If there's a God or any kind of justice under the sky
If there's a point, if there's a reason to live or die
Ha, if there's an answer to the questions we feel bound to ask
Show yourself - destroy our fears - release your mask
Oh yes, we'll keep on trying
Hey, tread that fine line
(yeah) yeah
We'll keep on smiling, yeah
(yeah) (yeah) (yeah)
And whatever will be - will be
We'll just keep on trying
We'll just keep on trying
Till the end of time
Till the end of time
Till the end of time&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I don't want my freedom
There's no reason for living with a broken heart

This is a tricky situation
I've only got myself to blame
It's just a simple fact of life
It can happen to any one

You win - you lose
It's a chance you have to take with love
Oh yeah - I fell in love
But now you say it's over and I'm falling apart

Yeah yeah
It's a hard life
To be true lovers together
To love and live forever in each others hearts
It's a long hard fight
To learn to care for each other
To trust in one another right from the start
When you're in love

I try and mend the broken pieces
Ooh, I try to fight back the tears
Ooh, they say it's just a state of mind
But it happens to everyone

How it hurts (yeah) - deep inside (oh yeah)
When your love has cut you down to size
This life is tough - on your own
Now I'm waiting for something to fall from the skies
I'm waiting for love

Yes it's a hard life
Two lovers together
To love and live forever in each others hearts
It's a long hard fight
To learn to care for each other
To trust in one another - right from the start
When you're in love

Yes it's a hard life
In a world that's filled with sorrow
There are people searching for love in every way
It's a long hard fight
But I'll always live for tomorrow
I'll look back at myself and say I did it for love (ooh)
Yes I did it for love - for love - oh I did it for love&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;When love breaks up
When the dawn light wakes up
A new life is born - oooooh
Somehow I have to make this final breakthru... now!

Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
I wake up
Feel just fine
Your face
Fills my mind
I get religion quick
'Cos you're looking divine
Honey you're touching something, you're touchin' me
I'm under your thumb, under your spell, can't you see?
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthru - oh yeah

Breakthru, these barriers of pain
Breakthru, yeah, to the sunshine from the rain
Make my feelings known towards you
Turn my heart inside and out for you now
Somehow I have to make this final breakthru
Now! (now now now)
Oh yeah

Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Your smile
Speaks books to me
I break up
With each and every one of your looks at me
Honey you're starting something deep inside of me
Honey you're sparking something, this fire in me
I'm outta control, I wanna rush headlong into this ecstasy

If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you - ooh ooh ooh ooh
That would really be a breakthru
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthru
Oh yeah
Breakthru, breakthru

Break, hey
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you - ooh ooh ooh ooh
That would really be a breakthru

If I could only reach you

&lt;lyrics&gt;There's no time for us
There's no place for us
What is this thing that builds our dreams, yet slips away from us

Who wants to live forever
Who wants to live forever...?
Oh ooo oh
There's no chance for us
It's all decided for us
This world has only one sweet moment set aside for us

Who wants to live forever
Who wants to live forever
Ooh
Who dares to love forever
Oh oo woh, when love must die

But touch my tears with your lips
Touch my world with your fingertips
And we can have forever
And we can love forever
Forever is our today

Who wants to live forever
Who wants to live forever
Forever is our today
Who waits forever anyway?&lt;/lyrics&gt;

Hoop diddy diddy - hoop diddy do
Now you've got soup in the laundry bag
Now you've got strings, you're gonna lose your rag
You're gettin' in a fight
Then it ain't so groovy when you're screaming in the night
Let me out of this cheap 'B' movie
Headlong down the highway and you're rushing
Headlong out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping and you can't stop rockin'
And there's nothin' you can, nothin' you can
Nothin' you can do about it

When a red hot man meets a white hot lady
Hoop diddy diddy - hoop diddy do (ho)
Soon the fire starts a raging gets 'em more than half crazy
Hoop diddy diddy - hoop diddy do
Oh, now they start freaking everyway you turn
You can't start walking 'cos your feet got burned
It ain't no time to figure wrong from right
Cause reasons out the window
Better hold on tight - you're rushing headlong
Headlong out of control, yeah
You think you're so strong
There ain't no stopping and there's nothin' you, nothin' you
Nothin' you can do about it at all
Yeah yeah alright go
And you're rushing headlong down the highway
And you're rushing headlong out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping
There's nothin', nothin', nothin' you can do about it, yeah
Oooh oooh ooh ooh ooh
Ha ha
Headlong
Headlong
Rushing rushing, rushing rushing
Yeah yeah yeah
Rushing rushing, rushing rushing
Headlong
Yeahaw
Headlong

Gnoldaeh gnoldaeh gnoldaeh gnoldaeh&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Every drop of rain that falls in Sahara Desert says it all
It's a miracle
All God's creations great and small, the Golden Gate and the Taj Mahal
That's a miracle
Test tube babies being born, mothers, fathers dead and gone
It's a miracle
We're having a miracle on earth, mother nature does it all for us
The wonders of this world go on, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon
Captain Cook and Cain and Abel, Jimi Hendrix to the Tower of Babel
It's a miracle, it's a miracle, it's a miracle, it's a miracle
The one thing we're all waiting for, is peace on Earth - an end to war
It's a miracle we need - the miracle
The miracle we're all waiting for today
If every leaf on every tree, could tell a story that would be a miracle
If every child on every street, had clothes to wear and food to eat
That's a miracle
If all God's people could be free, to live in perfect harmony
It's a miracle, we're having a miracle on Earth
Mother nature does it all for us
(the wonders of this world go on)
Open hearts and surgery, Sunday mornings with a cup of tea
Super powers always fighting
But Mona Lisa just keeps on smiling
It's a miracle, it's a miracle, it's a miracle

(The wonders of this world go on)
Well it's a miracle, it's a miracle, it's a miracle, it's a miracle
The one thing (the one thing)
We're all waiting for (we're all waiting for)
Is peace on Earth (peace on Earth) and an end to war (end to war)
It's a miracle we need, the miracle, the miracle
Peace on Earth and end to war today
That time will come one day you'll see when we can all be friends
That time will come one day you'll see when we can all be friends
That time will come one day you'll see when we can all be friends
That time will come one day you'll see when we can all be friends
That time will come&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;When the outside temperature rises
And the meaning is oh so clear
One thousand and one yellow daffodils
Begin to dance in front of you - oh dear
Are they trying to tell you something?
You're missing that one final screw
You're simply not in the pink my dear
To be honest you haven't got a clue
I'm going slightly mad
I'm going slightly mad
It finally happened - happened
It finally happened - ooh woh
It finally happened - I'm slightly mad - oh dear!
Ha ha ha ha ha

I'm one card short of a full deck
I'm not quite the shilling
One wave short of a shipwreck
I'm not my usual top billing
I'm coming down with a fever
I'm really out to sea
This kettle is boiling over
I think I'm a banana tree
Oh dear
I'm going slightly mad
I'm going slightly mad (I'm going slightly mad)
It finally happened - happened
It finally happened - uh huh
It finally happened - I'm slightly mad - oh dear!

Uh uh ah ah
Uh uh ah ah

I'm knitting with only one needle
Unraveling fast it's true
I'm driving only three wheels these days
But my dear, how about you?
I'm going slightly mad
I'm going slightly mad
It finally happened
It finally happened - oh yes
It finally happened - I'm slightly mad!
Just very slightly mad!
And there you have it!&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
Incredible how you can
See right through me

Freddie Mercury
When you hear a sound
That you just can't place
Feel somethin' move
That you just can't trace
When something sits
On the end of your bed
Don't turn around
When you hear me tread

I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
Incredible how you can
See right through me
I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
It's criminal how I can
See right through you

John Deacon
And I'm in your room
And I'm in your bed
And I'm in your life
And I'm in your head
Like CIA
Or the FBI
You'll never get close
Never take me alive

I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
Incredible how you can
See right through me
I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
It's criminal how I can
See right through you
Hah, hah, hah, hello
Hah, hah, hah, OK
Hah, hah, hah, hello-hello-hello-hello
Never had a real good friend - not a boy or girl
No-one knows what I've been through - let my flag unfurl
So I make my mark from the edge of the world
From the edge of the world
From the edge of the world

Brian May - Brian May

Now I'm on your track
And I'm in your mind
And I'm on your back
But don't look behind
I'm your meanest thought
I'm your darkest fear
But I'll never get caught
You can't shake me, shake me dear

I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
Incredible how you can
See right through me
Watch me now
I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
It's criminal how I can
See right through you
Look at me, look at me
R-R-R-R-Roger Taylor
Shake me, shake me, shake me dear
Sh-shake
Shake
Fun&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Yeah
Here we stand or here we fall
History won't care at all
Make the bed, light the light
Lady mercy won't be home tonight

Yeah, you don't waste no time at all
Don't hear the bell but you answer the call
It comes to you as to us all
Hey, we're just waiting
For the hammer to fall - yeah

Oh every night, and every day
A little piece of you is falling away
But lift your face, the western way, baby
Build your muscles as your body decays

Yeah, toe your line and play their game
Yeah, let the anaesthetic cover it all
Till one day they call your name
You know it's time for the hammer to fall - yeah

Rich or poor or famous for
Your truth it's all the same - oh no - oh no
Oh lock your door but rain is pouring
Through your window pane - oh no - yeah
Baby now your struggle's all vain

Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh

For we who grew up tall and proud
In the shadow of the mushroom cloud
Convinced our voices can't be heard
We just wanna scream it louder and louder and louder

What the hell we fighting for?
Ah, just surrender and it won't hurt at all
You just got time to say your prayers
Eh, while you're waiting for the hammer to hammer to fall
Hey, yes, it's starting to fall eh, hammer, you know
Yeah, hammer to fall, wooh, ah, hey, eh woowoo, ha eh hammer
Waiting for the hammer to fall baby
Yeah yeah while you're waiting for the hammer to fall
Give it to me one more time&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Another red letter day
So the pound has dropped and the children are creating
The other half ran away
Taking all the cash and leaving you with the lumber
Got a pain in the chest
Doctors on strike what you need is a rest

It's not easy love, but you've got friends you can trust
Friends will be friends
When you're in need of love they give you care and attention
Friends will be friends
When you're through with life and all hope is lost
Hold out your hand 'cos friends will be friends - right till the end

Now it's a beautiful day
The postman delivered a letter from your lover
Only a 'phone call away
You tried to track him down but somebody stole his number
As a matter of fact
You're getting used to life without him in your way

It's so easy now, 'cos you got friends you can trust
Friends will be friends
When you're in need of love they give you care and attention
Friends will be friends
When you're through with life and all hope is lost
Hold out your hand 'cos friends will be friends - right till the end

It's so easy now, 'cos you got friends you can trust
Friends will be friends
When you're in need of love they give you care and attention
Friends will be friends
When you're through with life and all hope is lost
Hold out your hand - friends will be friends - right till the end

Friends will be friends
When you're in need of love they give you care and attention
Friends will be friends
When you're through with life and all hope is lost
Hold out your hand 'cos right till the end - friends will be friends
Yeah yeah&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Empty spaces - what are we living for
Abandoned places - I guess we know the score
On and on, does anybody know what we are looking for...
Another hero, another mindless crime
Behind the curtain, in the pantomime
Hold the line, does anybody want to take it anymore
The show must go on
The show must go on, yeah
Inside my heart is breaking
My make-up may be flaking
But my smile still stays on

Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance
Another heartache, another failed romance
On and on, does anybody know what we are living for?
I guess I'm learning (I'm learning learning learning)
I must be warmer now
I'll soon be turning (turning turning turning)
Round the corner now
Outside the dawn is breaking
But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free
The show must go on
The show must go on, yeah yeah
Ooh, inside my heart is breaking
My make-up may be flaking
But my smile still stays on

Yeah yeah, whoa wo oh oh

My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies
Fairytales of yesterday will grow but never die
I can fly - my friends
The show must go on (go on, go on, go on) yeah yeah
The show must go on (go on, go on, go on)
I'll face it with a grin
I'm never giving in
On - with the show

Ooh, I'll top the bill, I'll overkill
I have to find the will to carry on
On with the show
On with the show
The show - the show must go on
Go on, go on, go on, go on, go on
Go on, go on, go on, go on, go on
Go on, go on, go on, go on, go on
Go on, go on, go on, go on, go on
Go on, go on&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;You say New York, New York is dangerous
Cause you read that where you may
Even a blind man could see that's not so
Love love love love love...
Ray
People on streets
Ha ha haa ey

Mm ba ba de
Um bum ba de
Um bu bu bum da de
Why don't we give all that one more chance?
Pressure pressure pressure pressure pressure
Pressure pressure pressure pressure pressure
Ppushing down on me
Pressing down on you no man ask for
Under pressure that brings a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets
Um ba ba be
Um ba ba be
De day da
Ee day da - that's OK
It's the terror of knowing
What the world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming 'Let me out'
Pray tomorrow - gets me higher
Pressure on people - people on streets
Day day de day day de
Day day de day day de
Day day de day day de
Day day de day day de
Day day de day day de
OK
Chippin' around kick my brains around the floor
These are the days it never rains but it pours
Ee do ba be
Ee da ba ba ba
Um bo bo
Be lap
People on streets - ee da de da de
People on streets - ee da de da de da de da
It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming 'Let me out'
Tomorrow - gets me higher higher high
Pressure on people - people on streets

Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love but it's so slashed and torn
Why - why - why?
Love love love love love love love

Insanity laughs under pressure we're breaking
Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more chance
Why can't we give love give love give love give love
Give love give love give love give love give love
'Cause love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the (People on streets) edge of the night
And loves (People on streets) dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves
Under pressure
Under pressure
Pressure&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I had this perfect dream
Un sueno me envolvió
This dream was me and you
Tal vez está aquí
I want all the world to see
Un instinto me guiaba
A miracle sensation
My guide and inspiration
Now my dream is slowly coming true
The wind is a gentle breeze
Él me habló de ti
The bells are ringing out
Él canto vuela
They're calling us together
Guiding us forever
Wish my dream would never go away

Barcelona
It was the first time that we met
Barcelona
How can I forget
The moment that you stepped into the room
You took my breath away

Barcelona
La música vibró
Barcelona
Y ella nos unió
And if God is willing
We will meet again
Someday

Let the songs begin
Déjalo nacer
Let the music play
Ahhhhhhh...
Make the voices sing
Nace un gran amor
Start the celebration
Ven a mí
And cry
Grita
Come alive
Vive
And shake the foundations from the skies
Shaking all our lives

Barcelona
Such a beautiful horizon
Barcelona
Like a jewel in the sun
Por ti seré gaviota de tu bella mar
Barcelona
Suenan las campanas
Barcelona
Abre tus puertas al mundo
If God is willing
If God is willing
If God is willing
Friends until the end

Viva!
Barcelona!&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I'm just the pieces of the man I used to be
Too many bitter tears are raining down on me
I'm far away from home
And I've been facing this alone
For much too long
Oh, I feel like no-one ever told the truth to me
About growing up and what a struggle it would be
In my tangled state of mind
I've been looking back to find
Where I went wrong

Too much love will kill you
If you can't make up your mind
Torn between the lover
And the love you leave behind
You're headed for disaster
'Cos you never read the signs
Too much love will kill you - every time

I'm just the shadow of the man I used to be
And it seems like there's no way out of this for me
I used to bring you sunshine
Now all I ever do is bring you down
Ooh, how would it be if you were standing in my shoes
Can't you see that it's impossible to choose
No there's no making sense of it
Every way I go I'm bound to lose
Oh yes

Too much love will kill you
Just as sure as none at all
It'll drain the power that's in you
Make you plead and scream and crawl
And the pain will make you crazy
You're the victim of your crime
Too much love will kill you - every time

Yes, too much love will kill you
It'll make your life a lie
Yes, too much love will kill you
And you won't understand why
You'd give your life, you'd sell your soul
But here it comes again
Too much love will kill you
In the end
In the end&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;This could be heaven
This could be heaven
This could be heaven
This could be heaven
This could be heaven for everyone

In these days of cool reflection (reflection)
You come to me and everything seems alright
In these days of cold affections
You sit by me - and everything's fine

This could be heaven for everyone
This world could be fed, this world could be fun
This could be heaven for everyone
This world could be free, this world could be one

In this world of cool deception
Just your smile can smooth my ride
These troubled days of cruel rejection, hmm
You come to me, soothe my troubled mind

Yeah, this could be heaven for everyone
This world could be fed, (yeah) this world could be fun
This should be love for everyone, yeah
This world should be free, (yeah) this world could be one
We should bring love to our daughters and sons
Love, love, love love, this could be heaven for everyone
You know that
This could be heaven for everyone, yea he he he - woh
This could be heaven for everyone

Listen - what people do to other souls
They take their lives - destroy their goals
Their basic pride and dignity
Is stripped and torn and shown no pity
When this should be heaven for everyone

This could be heaven
This could be heaven
This could be heaven for everyone
This could be heaven
Could be heaven for everyone
This could be heaven
This could be heaven
This could be heaven
Could be heaven for everyone
This could be heaven
This could be heaven
This could be heaven
Could be heaven for everyone
This could be heaven
Love love love
This could be heaven
This could be heaven wooh
This could be heaven
This could be heaven
This could be heaven
This could be heaven
For everyone
For everyone&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Don't touch me now
Don't hold me now
Don't break the spell darling, now you are near
Look in my eyes
And speak to me
Those special promises I long to hear
Las palabras de amor
Let me hear the words of love
Despacito mi amor
Love me slow and gently
One foolish world, so many souls
Senselessly hurled through the never ending cold
And all for fear, and all for greed
Speak any tongue but for God's sake we need
Las palabras de amor
Let me hear the words of love
Despacito mi amor
Let me know, this night and evermore
This room is bare
This night is cold
We're far apart and I'm growing old
But while we live, we'll meet again
So then my love we may whisper once more
It's you I adore
Las palabras de amor
Let me hear the words of love
Despacito mi amor
Touch me now - oh wooh hoo
Las palabras de amor
Let us share the words of love
For evermore (for evermore)
For evermore
Wooo&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Woh - everything I do I do for you
Ow
Oh yeah

We touch and you're afraid of me
And we burn and now I'm at your feet
High speed, but you know you're in safe hands
Ooh, in the dark we make a brighter light
From one spark to the horizon wide
We trust, and together we tame the land, yeah

Oh you'd be forgiven if you think you're dreaming
But we're working night and day to make a dream come true, yeah
Everything I do is driven by you
Oh, come on babe

Oh well it's tough to make a journey through
The right stuff is dead ahead of you and me
And you know we still got time
Whoo, hold on tight to the driving wheel
This ride is really out of line
Raw deal, but there's no other that's worth a dime

You know I love you but you drive me crazy
'Cos you're saying all the things I want to say to you
(You say) Everything I do is driven by you
Everything we do, oh yeah, everything we do
Everything we do, everything we do
Everything we do is driven by you

Inner children lost their way
Now they know the price you pay
I'm holding on to life with you
'Cos life without you just won't do

Driven by you

Ahh, you know we're never gonna know who's dreaming
But we're working night and day to make the dream come true
Yeah everything I do is driven by you
Everything we do, everything we do, everything we do
Yeah everything we do, everything we do, yeah everything we do
Everything we do, everything we do, everything we do...
...is driven by, driven by, driven by you

Yeah
Ooooh everything I dooo, I do for you&lt;/lyrics&gt;

Nowhere to go, nothing to do with my time

And everything is coming down on me, down on me, I go crazy
Oh so crazy, living on my own

Find my head is always up in the clouds in a dreamworld
It's not easy, living on my own, my own, my own

&lt;lyrics&gt;Three four
Ooh
Take a piece of my heart
Take a piece of my soul
Let me live
Oh yeah

Why don't you take another little piece of my heart
Why don't you take it and break it
And tear it all apart
All I do is give
And all you do is take
Baby why don't you give me
A brand new start

So let me live (So let me live)
Let me live (Leave me alone)
Let me live, oh baby
And make a brand new start

Why don't you take another little piece of my soul
Why don't you shape it and shake it
'Til you're really in control
All you do is take
And all I do is give
All that I'm askin'
Is a chance to live

(So let me live) - So let me live
(Leave me alone) - Let me live, let me live
Why don't you let me make a brand new start

Yeah, and it's a long hard struggle, yeah yeah
But you can always depend on me
And if you're ever in trouble - hey
You know where I will be

Why don't you take another little piece of my life
Why don't you twist it and turn it
And cut it like a knife
All you do is live
All I do is die
Why can't we just be friends
Stop livin' a lie

So let me live (So let me live)
Let me live (Leave me alone)
Please let me live
(Why don't you live a little)
Oh yeah baby
(Why don't you give a little love...?)
Go for it baby

Let me live
Please let me live
Oh yeah baby, let me live
And make a brand new start
Let me live (Let me live)
Ooh yeah (Let me live)
Come on (Let me live ooh)

In your heart, oh baby
(Take another piece, take another piece)
(Take another piece, take another piece)
Ooh please let me live
(Take another piece, take another piece)
(Take another piece, take another piece)
Why don't you take another piece
Take another little piece of my heart
Oh yeah baby
Make a brand new start
Baby baby
Baby baby
Baby baby
Baby baby
All you do is take, take
Let me live
(Let me live)
Oh yeah let
Let me live&lt;/lyrics&gt;

Pretending I'm doing well (ooh ooh ooh)
My need is such
I pretend too much
I'm lonely but no-one can tell

Oh yes I'm the great pretender (ooh ooh ooh)
Adrift in a world of my own (ooh ooh ooh)
I play the game
But to my real shame
You've left me to dream all alone

Too real is this feeling of make (make believe) believe
Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal

Oh oh, yes I'm the great pretender (ooh ooh ooh)
Just laughing and gay like a clown (ooh ooh ooh)
I seem to be what I'm not you see (ooh you see)
I'm wearing my heart like a clown
Pretend that you're still around
Yeah-eah, wooh hoo

Too real (real) when I feel (feel) what my heart can't conceal

&lt;lyrics&gt;A hand above the water
An angel reaching for the sky
Is it raining in Heaven
Do you want us to cry?

And everywhere the broken-hearted
On every lonely avenue
No-one could reach them
No-one but you

One by one
Only the Good die young
They're only flying to close to the sun
And life goes on
Without you...

Another tricky situation
I get to drowning in the Blues
And I find myself thinking
Well - what would you do?

Yes! - it was such an operation
Forever paying every due
Hell, you made a sensation
(sensation)
You found a way through - and
(You found a way through)

One by one
Only the Good die young
They're only flying to close to the sun
We'll remember
Forever...

And now the party must be over
I guess we'll never understand
The sense of your leaving
Was it the way it was planned?

And so we grace another table
And raise our glasses one more time
There's a face at the window
And I ain't never, never saying goodbye...

One by one
Only the Good die young
They're only flying to close to the sun
Crying for nothing
Crying for no-one
No-one but you&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Sometimes I get to feelin'
I was back in the old days - long ago
When we were kids, when we were young
Things seemed so perfect - you know?
The days were endless, we were crazy - we were young
The sun was always shinin' - we just lived for fun
Sometimes it seems like lately - I just don't know
The rest of my life's been - just a show
Those were the days of our lives
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone now but one thing is true
When I look and I find I still love you
You can't turn back the clock, you can't turn back the tide
Ain't that a shame?
Ooh, I'd like to go back one time on a roller coaster ride
When life was just a game
No use in sitting and thinkin' on what you did
When you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids
Sometimes it seems like lately - I just don't know
Better sit back and go - with the flow
'Cos these are the days of our lives
They've flown in the swiftness of time
These days are all gone now but some things remain
When I look and I find - no change
Those were the days of our lives yeah
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone now but one thing's still true
When I look and I find, I still love you
I still love you&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Oh my love we've had
Our share of tears
Oh my friends we've had
Our hopes and fears
Oh my friend it's been
A long hard year
But now it's Christmas
Yes it's Christmas
Thank God it's Christmas

The moon and stars
Seem awful cold and bright
Let's hope the snow will
Make this Christmas right

My friend the world will share
This special night
Because it's Christmas
Yes it's Christmas
Thank God it's Christmas
For one night
Thank God it's Christmas
Yeah thank God it's Christmas
Thank God it's Christmas
Can it be Christmas
Let it be Christmas every day

Oh my love we live
In troubled days
Oh my friend we have
The strangest ways
Oh my friends on this
One day of days
Thank God it's Christmas
Yes it's Christmas
Thank God it's Christmas
For one day

Thank God it's Christmas
Yes it's Christmas
Thank God it's Christmas
Wooh yeah

Thank God it's Christmas
For one day yeah - Christmas

A very merry Christmas to you all&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Just one year of love
Is better than a lifetime alone
One sentimental moment in your arms
Is like a shooting star right through my heart
It's always a rainy day without you
I'm a prisoner of love inside you
I'm falling apart all around you - yeah

My heart cries out to your heart
I'm lonely but you can save me
My hand reaches out for your hand
I'm cold but you light the fire in me
My lips search for your lips
I'm hungry for your touch
There's so much left unspoken
And all I can do is surrender
To the moment just surrender

And no one ever told me that love would hurt so much
(ooh yes it hurts)
And pain is so close to pleasure
And all I can do is surrender to your love
Ooh, just surrender to your love
Just one year of love
Is better than a lifetime alone
One sentimental moment in your arms
Is like a shooting star right through my heart
It's always a rainy day without you
I'm a prisoner of love inside you
I'm falling apart all around you
And all I can do is surrender&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure, oh yeah
Sunshine and rainy weather go hand in hand together all your life
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure everybody knows
One day we love each other then we're fighting one another all the time
When I was young and just getting started
And people talked to me they sounded broken hearted
Then I grew up and got my imagination
And all I wanted was to start a new relation
So in love but love had a bad reaction
I was looking for some good old satisfaction
But pain is all I got when all I needed was some love and affection
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure, yeah, yeah
Sunshine and rainy weather go hand in hand together all your life
Pain and pleasure
Ooh, ooh, pain and pleasure

When your plans go wrong - you turn out the light
But inside of your mind you put up a fight
Where are the answers that we're all searching for
There's nothing in this world to be sure of anymore
Some days you're feeling good, some days you're feeling bad
But if you're feeling happy someone else is always sad
Let the sweetness on love wipe the tears from your face
For better for worse, so let's make the best of the rest of our years
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure, I told you so
Sunshine and rainy weather go hand in hand together all your life
Pain and pleasure, ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure, yeah, yeah
Sunshine and rainy weather go hand in hand together all your life
All your life
Ooh ooh ooh
Pain - pleasure - pain - pleasure - pain - pleasure - pain - pleasure&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;&quot;... in the garage with water from the sprinklers.&quot;
&quot;He'd also left a man's decapitated body lying on the floor next to his own severed head.&quot;
&quot;A head which at this time has no name...&quot;

- I know his name

Here I am, I'm the master of your destiny, ha haa
I am the one, the only one, I am the God of kingdom come
Gimme the prize, just gimme the prize
Give me your kings, let me squeeze them in my hands, hey hey hey
Your puny princes
Your so-called leaders of your land
I'll eat them whole before I'm done
The battle's fought and the game is won
I am the one the only one
I am the God of kingdom come
Gimme the prize, just gimme the prize
- The prize

- Ha ha ha ha ha ha
- Ha ha ha ha ha ha
- Now you die
- Ha ha ha ha ha ha
- I have something to say - it's better to burn out than to fade away
- Heeargh
- There can be only one
- Eeaaoooor

Move over, I said move over
Hey, hey, hey clear the way
There's no escape from my authority - mmm, I tell you
I am the one, the only one, I am the God of kingdom come
Gimme the prize
- The prize
Just gimme the prize
- The prize
I am the one the only one
I am the God of kingdom come
Just gimme the prize

&lt;lyrics&gt;Friends will be friends
Friends will be friends

Friends will be friends
Friends will be friends
Friends will be friends

Another red letter day
So the pound has dropped and the children are creating
The other half ran away
Taking all the cash and leaving you with the lumber
Got a pain in the chest
Doctors on strike what you need is a rest

It's not easy love, but you've got friends you can trust
Friends will be friends
When you're in need of love they give you care and attention
Friends will be friends
When you're through with life and all hope is lost
Hold out your hand 'cos friends will be friends - right till the end

Now it's a beautiful day
The postman delivered a letter from your lover
Only a 'phone call away
You tried to track him down but somebody stole his number
As a matter of fact
You're getting used to life without him in your way

It's so easy now, 'cos you got friends you can trust
Friends will be friends
When you're in need of love they give you care and attention
Friends will be friends
When you're through with life and all hope is lost
Hold out your hand 'cos friends will be friends - right till the end

It's so easy now, 'cos you got friends you can trust
Friends will be friends
When you're in need of love they give you care and attention
Friends will be friends
When you're through with life and all hope is lost
Hold out your hand 'cos right till the end - friends will be friends
Yeah yeah&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Aah
You suck my blood like a leech
You break the law and you preach
Screw my brain till it hurts
You've taken all my money - and you want more

Misguided old mule
With your pigheaded rules
With your narrow-minded cronies who are fools
Of the first division

Death on two legs
You're tearing me apart
Death on two legs
You never had a heart of your own

Kill joy, bad guy
Big talking, small fry
You're just an old barrow-boy
Have you found a new toy to replace me
Can you face me

But now you can kiss my ass goodbye

Feel good, are you satisfied?
Do you feel like suicide (I think you should)
Is your conscience all right
Does it plague you at night
Do you feel good - feel good

Aah
Talk like a big business tycoon
But you're just a hot-air balloon
So no one gives you a damn
You're just an overgrown school-boy
Let me tan your hide

A dog with disease
You're the king of the 'sleaze'
Put your money where your mouth is Mr. know all
Was the fin on your back part of the deal... (a shark!)

Death on two legs
Tearing me apart
Death on two legs
You've never had a heart of your own
(You never did, right from the start)

Insane, you should be put inside
You're a sewer-rat decaying in a cesspool of pride
Should be made unemployed
Make yourself null-and-void
Make me feel good
I feel good&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I go out to work on Monday morning
Tuesday I go off to honeymoon
I'll be back again before it's time for sunny-down
I'll be lazing on a Sunday afternoon
Bicycling on every Wednesday evening
Thursday I go waltzing to the zoo
I come from London Town, I'm just an ordinary guy
Fridays I go painting in the Louvre
I'm bound to be proposing on a Saturday night
(There he goes again)
I'll be lazing on a Sunday
Lazing on a Sunday
Lazing on a Sunday afternoon&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Oooh
The machine of a dream, such a clean machine
With the pistons a pumpin', and the hubcaps all gleam
When I'm holding your wheel
All I hear is your gear
With my hand on your grease gun
Mmm it's like a disease son
I'm in love with my car, gotta feel for my automobile
Get a grip on my boy racer rollbar
Such a thrill when your radials squeal

Told my girl I'll have to forget her
Rather buy me a new carburettor
So she made tracks saying this is the end now
Cars don't talk back they're just four wheeled friends now

When I'm holding your wheel
All I hear is your gear
When I'm cruisin' in overdrive
Don't have to listen to no run of the mill talk jive

I'm in love with my car (love with my car)
Gotta feel for my automobile
I'm in love with my car (love with my car)
String back gloves in my automolove&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;In the year of '39 assembled here the volunteers
In the days when the lands were few
Here the ship sailed out into the blue and sunny morn
Sweetest sight ever seen

And the night followed day
And the storytellers say
That the score brave souls inside
For many a lonely day sailed across the milky seas
Ne'er looked back, never feared, never cried

Don't you hear my call though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew

Aah, aah, aah, aah

In the year of '39 came a ship in from the blue
The volunteers came home that day
And they bring good news of a world so newly born
Though their hearts so heavily weigh
For the earth is old and grey, little darling we'll away
But my love this cannot be
Oh so many years have gone though I'm older but a year
Your mother's eyes from your eyes cry to me

Don't you hear my call though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you
Write your letters in the sand for the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew

Don't you hear my call though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you
All your letters in the sand cannot heal me like your hand

For my life
Still ahead
Pity me&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Ooh, I like it
You call me up and treat me like a dog
You call me up and tear me up inside
You've got me on a lead
Ooh, you bring me down
You shout around
You don't believe that I'm alone
Ooh, you don't believe me

Sweet lady
Sweet lady
Sweet lady sweet lady... ooh, stay sweet

You say
&quot;You call me up and feed me all the lines&quot;
&quot;You call me sweet like I'm some kind of cheese&quot;
&quot;Waiting on the shelf&quot;
&quot;You eat me up&quot;
&quot;You hold me down&quot;
&quot;I'm just a fool to make you a home&quot;
&quot;Ooh, you really do me&quot;

&quot;When you say&quot;
&quot;Sweet lady (sweet lady)&quot;
&quot;Sweet lady (sweet lady)&quot;
&quot;Sweet lady... ooh, come on, stay sweet&quot;

My sweet lady
Though it seems like we wait forever - oo ah oo
Stay sweet baby
Believe and we've got everything we need (got everything we need)
Ow

Sweet lady
Sweet lady
Sweet lady... ooh, ooh, stay sweet, stay sweet
Oh runaway, come on, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, sweet lady
Wooh&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Seaside
Whenever you stroll along with me
I'm merely contemplating what you feel inside (ooh ooh ooh)
Meanwhile I ask you to be my Clementine
You say you will if you could but you can't
I love you madly
Let my imagination run away with you gladly
A brand new angle
Highly commendable
Seaside rendezvous

I feel so romantic
Can we do it again
Can we do it again sometime
(Ooh, I like that)
Fantastic, c'est la vie Mesdames et Messieurs
And at the peak of the season
The Mediterranean
This time of year
It's so fashionable

Duh duh du du du du duh duh du duh
Duh duh du du du du duh duh
Ooh ooh ooh

I feel like dancing
In the rain
Can I have a volunteer?
(Just keep right on dancing)
What a damn jolly good idea
It's such a jollification as a matter of fact
So très charmant my dear

Underneath the moonlight
(Wooh ooh)
Together we'll sail across the sea 
(Shine on silvery moonlight)
Reminiscing every night
Meantime 
(And in the meantime baby)
I ask you to be my Valentine
You say you'd have to tell your daddy if you can
I'll be your Valentino
We'll ride upon an omnibus and then the casino
Get a new facial
Start a sensational
Seaside rendezvous
So adorable
Seaside rendezvous
Ooh ooh
Seaside rendezvous
Give us a kiss&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Oh oh people of the earth
Listen to the warning
The Seer he said
Beware the storm that gathers here
Listen to the wise man

I dreamed I saw on a moonlit stair
Spreading his hands on the multitude there
A man who cried for a love gone stale
And ice cold hearts of charity bare
I watched as fear took the old men's gaze
Hopes of the young in troubled graves
I see no day, I heard him say
So grey is the face of every mortal

Oh oh people of the earth
Listen to the warning
The prophet he said
For soon the cold of night will fall
Summoned by your own hand

Oh oh children of the land
Quicken to the new life
Take my hand
Ooh, fly and find the new green bough
Return like the white dove

He told of death as a bone white haze
Taking the lost and the unloved babe
Late too late all the wretches run
These kings of beasts now counting their days
From mother's love is the son estranged
Married his own his precious gain
The earth will shake in two will break
And death all around will be your dow'ry

Oh oh people of the earth
Listen to the warning the seer he said
For those who hear and mark my words
Listen to the good plan

Oh oh oh oh - and two by two my human zoo
They'll be
Running for to come
Running for to come
Out of the rain

Oh, flee for your life
Who heed me not, let all your treasure make you
Oh, fear for your life
Deceive you not the fires of hell will take you
Should death await you

Oh, oh, people can you hear me (oh, oh, people can you hear me)
(Oh, oh, people can you hear me)

Now I know (now I know) (now I know) (x3)
Now I know that you can hear me (now I know that you can hear me)
(Now I know that you can hear me)

Now I know (now I know) (now I know) (x10)
The Earth will shake in two will break in two will
Shake in two will break in two
(the earth will shake in two will break in two will
Shake in two will break in two)
(the earth will shake in two will break in two will
Shake in two will break in two)

Doubts all around around around around around around around around
(Doubts all around around around around around around around around)
(Doubts all around around around around around around around around)
Now I know (now I know) (now I know) (x11)
Wow ooh wow ooh wow ooh wow ooh wow ooh wow ooh wow ooh wow ooh
(Wow ooh wow ooh wow ooh wow ooh wow ooh wow ooh wow ooh wow ooh)
(Wow ooh wow ooh wow ooh wow ooh wow ooh wow ooh wow ooh wow ooh)
Listen to the wise (listen to the wise) (listen to the wise) (x4)
Listen to the wise man (listen to the wise man) (listen to the wise man)

Laa laa - la la la la laa laa (laa laa - la la la la laa laa)
La la la la laa laa (la la la la laa laa) (x6)
La la laa laa (la la laa laa)

I you come here (I you come here)

Listen to the mad (Listen to the mad)
Listen to the man (Listen to the man)
Listen to the mad (Listen to the mad)
Listen to the mad man (Listen to the mad man)

God give you the grace to purge this place
And peace all around may be your fortune

Oh oh children of the land
Love is still the answer, take my hand
The vision fades, a voice I hear
&quot;Listen to the madman!&quot;

Ooh, but still I fear and still I dare not
Laugh at the madman&lt;/lyrics&gt;

Don't take it away from me, because you don't know
What it means to me

Love of my life don't leave me
You've taken my love, (all of my love) and now desert me

Who will remember
When this is blown over
And everything's all by the way - (ooh yeah)
When I grow older
I will be there at your side to remind you
How I still love you - (I still love you)

Ooh, back - hurry back
Please bring it back home to me
Because you don't know what it means to me
Love of my life
Love of my life
Ooh, ooh&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Take good care of what you've got
My father said to me
As he puffed his pipe and baby B
He dandled on his knee
Don't fool with fools who'll turn away
Keep all good company
Oo hoo oo hoo
Take care of those you call your own
And keep good company

Soon I grew and happy too
My very good friends and me
We'd play all day with Sally J
The girl from number four
Very soon I begged her won't you
Keep me company
Oo hoo oo hoo
Oo hoo oo hoo
Come marry me for evermore we'll
Be good company

Now marriage is an institution sure
My wife and I our needs and nothing more
All my friends by a year
By and by disappeared
But we're safe enough behind our door

I flourished in my humble trade
My reputation grew
The work devoured my waking hours
But when my time was through
Reward of all my efforts my own
Limited company

I hardly noticed Sally as we
Parted company
All through the years in the end it appears
There was never really anyone but me

Now I'm old I puff my pipe
But no-one's there to see
I ponder on the lesson of
My life's insanity
Take care of those you call your own
And keep good company&lt;/lyrics&gt;

Every child - with a mighty flash

He knows nothing but a man
But he can never fail
No one but the pure in heart
May find the golden grail
Oh oh - oh oh

&lt;lyrics&gt;So you feel like you ain't nobody
Always needed to be somebody
Put your feet on the ground
Put your hand on your heart
Lift your head to the stars
And the world's for your taking
All you got to do is save the world
Yeah

So you feel like it's end of story
Find it all pretty satisfactory
Well I tell you my friend
This might seem like the end
But the continuation is
Yours for the making
Yes you're a hero
Ooh yeah

Flash - a-ah
He's for everyone of us
Stand for everyone of us
He'll save with a mighty hand (he'll save with a mighty hand)
He'll save with a mighty hand (he'll save with a mighty hand)
He'll save with a mighty hand (he'll save us)
Every man every woman every child
With a mighty
Flash a-ah&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Action
This street honey is a mean street
Living in this street honey needs a mean streak
We've got criminals living in this street
But there's a heartbeat pulse that keeps on pumping
Like a jukebox playing the same dead record
Or a radio in the corner keeps blaring
I gotta feeling, this world is using me
This town honey is a dead town
Living in this town honey is a let-down
Coming to this town honey is a showdown
But there's a heartbeat pulse that keeps on pumping
Some sunshine ray through a crack in a shutter
Or a sight of a light at the end of a tunnel
Still there's a feeling, this world is using me
Action this day
Action this night
Oh we've gotta learn to learn to live
You can't say it ain't right
Action this day
Action this night
Oh you've got the power, you've got the power
You've got the power to love and to live
You can't say it ain't right
Your mind honey is a bleak place
Living in your mind's living in a blank space
Your mind is coming from a rat race
But there's a heartbeat pulse that keeps on pumping
Like a jukebox playing the same dead record
Or a radio in the corner keeps blaring
I gotta feeling that just won't quit, this world is using me
Action this day yeah
Action this night
Ooh we've gotta learn to learn to live
We can't say it ain't right
Action this day yeah
Action this night
Oh you've got the power, you've got the power
You've got the power to love, to live
You can't say it ain't right

Action hey
Hey hey hey
Action this day
Action this day this day yeah
Action this day

Action this day, ha
Living in the street (action)

&lt;lyrics&gt;They called him a hero
In the land of the free
But he wouldn't shake my hand boy
He disappointed me
So I got my handgun
And I blew him away
That critter was a bad guy
I had to make him pay
You might fear for my reason
I don't care what they say
Look out baby it's the season
For the mad masquerade
Put out the fire
Put out the fire
Put out the fire
Oh you need a bullet like a hole in the head
Put out the fire
Put out the fire
Put out the fire
Don't believe what your granddaddy said

She was my lover
It was a shame that she died
But the constitution's right on my side
'Cos I caught my lover in my neighbour's bed
I got retribution, filled 'em all full of lead
I've been told it's the fashion
To let me on the streets again
It's nothing but a crime of passion
And I'm not to blame
Put out the fire
Put out the fire
Put out the fire
You need a weapon like a hole in the head
Put out the fire
Put out the fire baby
Put out the fire
And let your sons and your daughters
Sleep sound in their beds

You know a gun never killed nobody
You can ask anyone
People get shot by people
People with guns
Oh yeah put out the fire wooh
Put out the fire c'mon
You need a gun like a hole in the head
Put out the fire wooh
Put out the fire
Put out the fire yeah eah
Just tell me that old fashioned gun law is dead
Ha hey take it that far
Come on yeah shoot shoot haaa shoot shoot shoot&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Guilt stains on my pillow
Blood on my terraces
Torsos in my closet
Shadows from my past
Life is real
Life is real
Life is real, so real
Sleeping is my leisure
Waking up in a minefield
Dream is just a pleasure dome
Love is a roulette wheel
Life is real
Life is real
Life is real, oh yeah
Success is my breathing space
I brought it on myself
I will price it
I will cash it
I can take it or leave it
Loneliness is my hiding place
Breastfeeding myself
What more can I say
I have swallowed the bitter pill
I can taste it, I can taste it
Life is real
Life is real
Life is real
Music will be my mistress
Loving like a whore
Lennon is a genius
Living in every pore
Life is real
Life is real
Life is real, so real
Life is cruel
Life is a bitch
Life is real, so real
Life is real
Life is real
Yeah, life is real&lt;/lyrics&gt;

You're taking all the sunshine away
Making out like you're the mainline - I knew that
Cos you're a cool cat
Tapping on the toe with a new hat
Wooh, just cruising - driving along with the swing king
Feeling the beat of my heart ha hah
Feeling the beat of my heart
Ooh, you're a cool cat
Coming on strong with all the chit-chat
Ooh, you're all right
Hanging out and stealing all the limelight
Messing with the beat of my heart
Ooh, messing with the beat of my heart, yeah
Mmm, you used to be a mean kid
Making such a deal of life
Wooh, you were wishing and hoping and waiting to really hit the big time
But did it happen, happen, no
You're speeding too fast
Slow down slow down
You'd better slow down
Slow down
Hah, you really know how to set the mood
And you really get inside the groove, yeah
Cool cat
Tapping on the toe with a new hat
Ooh, just cruising
Driving along like the swing king
Feeling the beat of my heart
Feeling the beat of my heart - yeah yeah
Feeling the beat of my heart - can you feel it
Feeling the beat of my heart - yeah yeah
Feeling the beat of my heart
Wooh, wooh, feelin' feelin' feelin' it honey feelin' heee hooh&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I can't live with you
But I can't live without you
I can't let you stay
Oh but I can't live if you go away
I don't know just how it goes
All I know is I can't live with you
Yeah, I'm having a hard time
I'm walking a fine line
Between hope and despair
You may think that I don't care
But I travelled a long road to
Get a hold of my sorrow
I tried to catch a dream
But nothing's what it seems
Love is saying baby it's all right
When deep inside you're really petrified
Lover turns to hater
On this escalator
I can't live with you
Yeah, but I can't live without you
I can't breathe - if you stay
But I can't bear you to go away
I don't know what time it is
All I know is I can't live with you
We're stuck in a bad place
We're trapped in a rat race
And we can't escape
Maybe there's been some mistake
We're trying to make a high score
We're walking through a closed door
And nobody's winning
We're just sinning against ourselves
Hold on baby tell me it's all right
Anger's breaking from the hurt inside
Passions screaming hotter
Doin' what we gotta do - yeah
I can't live with you, I can't live with you
I can't live, I can't live
I can't, I can't live with you
But baby I'll never ever leave you
I can't live with you
But I can't live without you
Cause I'm in love with you
Ooh, and everything about you
I can't live with you
No I just can't live, I just can't live
I can't live with you
Yeah, and I can't live without you
Through the madness, through the tears
We've still got each other
For a million years

Yeah, ooh yeah, yeah
I can't live without you - eh yeah
I can't live without you
Yeah eah yeah
Whoa whooooa
I can't live without you
I can't live without you
I can't live without you
Whoa
I can't live without you

&lt;lyrics&gt;If you're searching out for something
Don't try so hard
I you're feeling kind of nothing
Don't try so hard
When your problems seem like mountains
Feel the need to find some answers
You can leave it for another day
Don't try so hard

But if you fall and take a tumble
It won't be far
If you fail you mustn't grumble
Thank your lucky stars
Just savour every mouthful
And treasure every moment
When the storms are raging round you
Stay right where you are
Oooh don't try so hard
Oooh don't take it all to heart
It's only fools they make these rules
Don't try so hard

One day you'll be a Sergeant Major
Oh you'll be so proud
Screaming out your bloody orders
Hey but not too loud
Polish all your shiny buttons
Dressed as lamb instead of mutton
But you never had to try
To stand out from the crowd

Oh what a beautiful world
Is this the life for me
Oh what a beautiful world
It's the simple life for me
Oooh

Oh don't try so hard
Oh don't take it all to heart
It's only fools they make these rules
Don't try so hard
Don't try so hard
Don't try so hard&lt;/lyrics&gt;

You bring me hope, you make me laugh - and I like it

When you pee all over my Chippendale suite

You take over my house and home
You even try to answer my telephone
Delilah, you're the apple of my eyes

&lt;lyrics&gt;Here we go, yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
Hey, I'm the hitman
Stand aside
I'm the hitman
I want your life
Ain't no escaping
Don't run and hide
There goes the neighbourhood
I'm gonna kill for your love, that's right
Hitman
Now don't you cry
I'm just it man
You might get fried
Gun in my pocket
Don't get me wrong
I'll be your hitman - I'm a fool for your love
I'm a head shredder
That's better
Baby baby baby
I'm a hitman - hitman - hitman
Aargh
Yeah - trouble in the east, troubled in the west
Struggle with the beast - what a thief, what a pest
Come back mother, nuke that sucker
Yeah - yeah - yeah
Who's that man talking about?
Waste that brother
Alright
Ooh
That's the way to do it
Haa ha
I'm the hitman, I'm your prize
But this hitman
Can cut you down to size
Love me baby
Don't be so cool
Love me love me baby
I've been to the hitman school
Yeah - yeah
You're gonna make my day
Gonna blow you away
When the fun begins
Hitman
Are you ready for the sting
Gonna waste that thing
Hitman, hitman is king
Yeah
Go go
Yeah yeah yeah
Oh hitman hitman
Yeah yeah hitman&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Oh how wrong can you be?
Oh to fall in love
Was my very first mistake
How was I to know
I was far too much in love to see?
Oh jealousy look at me now
Jealousy you got me somehow
You gave me no warning
Took me by surprise
Jealousy you led me on
You couldn't lose, you couldn't fail
You had suspicion on my trail

How how how all my jealousy
I wasn't man enough to let you hurt my pride
Now I'm only left with my own jealousy

Oh how strong can you be
With matters of the heart?
Life is much too short
To while away with tears
If only you could see
Just what you do to me (oh jealousy)
Jealousy you tripped me up
Jealousy you brought me down
You bring me sorrow, you cause me pain
Jealousy when will you let go?
Gotta hold of my possessive mind
Turned me into a jealous kind

How how how all my jealousy
I wasn't man enough to let you hurt my pride
Now I'm only left with my own jealousy
But now it matters not
If I should live or die
'Cause I'm only left with my own jealousy&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Keep your chin up when you're feelin' lonely
Don't let them get you down
Ain't no use in you sitting all alone
Hangin' around for someone to call
Ooh they won't come knockin' at all
Don't run and hide
Even if it hurts you inside
So I said
Give as good as you get - yeah

If you can't beat 'em, join 'em
You've got to do it
'Cause it makes you feel good
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em
You're never gonna help yourself

Yeah, come on, go, get up, hey, sure feelin' good

Keep your fingers off my money
Don't try and pull me down
You're takin' me out to wine and dine me
Tryin' to wind me 'round and around
Invite me to your little contract ha! ha!
Rumour has it that you could play dirty
I'll tell you what I'll do about that and that oh yeah
I'm playing them at their own game - yeah!

If you can't beat 'em, join 'em
You've got to do it
'Cause it makes you feel good
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em
You're never gonna help yourself

Yeah, that's good, playing dirty

If you can't beat 'em, join 'em
Oh, you've got to do it
'Cause it makes you feel good
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em

It's everyone for themselves

Move on out, hey
Hey
All right, let rock 'n' roll reign
Hey whooh hoo&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Hey it's a sell out - hey
Let me welcome you Ladies and Gentlemen
I would like to say hello
Are you ready for some entertainment?
Are you ready for a show?
Gonna rock you gonna roll you
Get you dancing in the aisles
Jazz you, razzmatazz you
With a little bit of style
C'mon let me entertain you
Let me entertain you
Let me entertain you
Let me entertain you

I've come here to sell you my body
I can show you some good merchandise
I'll pull you and I'll pill you
I'll crueladeville you
And to thrill you I'll use any device

A ha ha ha haa

We'll give you crazy performance
We'll give you grounds for divorce
We'll give you piece de resistance
And a tour de force of course

We found the right location
Got a lot of pretty lights
The sound and the amplification listen
Hey if you need a fix if you want a high
Stickells 'll see to that
With Electra and EMI
We'll show you where it's at
So c'mon let me entertain you
Let me entertain you
Let me entertain you
Let me entertain you

Just take a look at the menu
We give you rock a la carte
We'll breakfast at Tiffany's
We'll sing to you in Japanese
We're only here to entertain you

If you want to see some action
You get nothing but the best
The 'S' and 'M' attraction
We've got the pleasure chest
Chicago down to New Orleans
We get you on the line
If you dig the New York scene
We'll have a son of a bitch of a time
C'mon
Let me entertain let me entertain
Let me entertain you tonight

Hey where's my backstage pass?
Hey that Brian May he's outta sight man
Hey that was a bit of alright wasn't it
Outrageous costumes
Not many not many
And I always wanted to be in opera
Oh man I could give you lessons if you like&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Monday the start of my holiday
Freedom for just one week
Feels good to get away ooh

Tuesday saw her down on the beach
I stood and watched a while
And she looked and smiled at me

Wednesday I didn't see her
I hoped that she'd be back tomorrow
And then on Thursday
My luck had changed
She stood there all alone
I went and asked her name
I never thought that this could happen to me
In only seven days
It would take a hundred or more
For memories to fade

I wish Friday could last forever
I held her close to me
I couldn't bear to leave her there

Saturday just twenty four hours
Oh no I'm goin' back home on Sunday

I'm so sad alone&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Oh I used to be your baby
Used to be your pride and joy
Mmm, You used to take me dancing
Just like any other boy
But now you've found another partner
And left me like a broken toy

Oh it's someone else you're taking
Someone else you're playin' to
Honey though I'm aching
Know just what I have to do
If I can't have you when I'm wakin'
I'll go to sleep and dream I'm with you

Oh take me take me take me
To the dreamer's ball
Mmm, I'll be right on time and I'll dress so fine
You're gonna love me when you see me
I won't have to worry
Take me take me
Promise not to wake me till it's morning
It's all been true

What do you say about that then honey?
Are you gonna take me to that dreamer's ball?
I'd like that
Right on that forty second street
Way down down town we must go

Oh take me take me take me
I'm your plaything now
You make my life worthwhile with the slightest smile
Or destroy me with a barely perceptible whisper
Gently take me remember I'll be dreamin' of my baby
At the dreamer's ball

Oh, take me hold me
Remember what you told me
You'd meet me at the dreamer's ball
I'll meet you at the dreamer's ball
Ooh&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I take a step outside
And I breathe the air
And I slam the door
And I'm on my way
I won't lay no blame
I won't call you names
'Cause I've made my break
And I won't look back
I've turned my back
On those endless games

I'm all through with ties
I'm all tired of tears
I'm a happy man
Don't it look that way?
Shakin' dust from my shoes
There's a road ahead
And there's no way back home (no way back home)
Oh oh but I have to say

Leavin' home ain't easy
Oh I never thought it would be easy
Leavin' on your own
Ah, Is the main thing calling me back?
Leavin' home ain't easy
On the one you're leavin' home

Stay my love my love please stay
Don't stray my love what's wrong my love?
What's right my love?
Oh leavin' home ain't easy
I thought how could I think of leavin'?
Leavin' on your own
Still tryin' to persuade me that
Leaving home ain't necessarily
The only way
Leavin' home ain't easy
But may be the only way&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;If you're feelin' tired and lonely
Uninspired and lonely
If you're thinkin' how the days seem long
All you're given
Is what you've been given
A thousand times before
Just more more
More of that jazz
More no more of that jazz (thank you)
Give me no more
No more of that jazz

Huh, only football gives us thrills
Rock 'n' roll just pays the bills
Only our team is the real team
Bring out the dogs get on your feet
Lie on the floor
Kinda thinkin' I've heard that line before
Just more
More of that jazz
More no more of that jazz
Give me no more
No more of that jazz

Oh no matter fool
Got no business hangin' around and tellin' lies
Bicycle races are coming your way
If you can't beat 'em join them
Fun it
Are you're gonna let it all hang out?
Fat bottomed girls you make the rocking world go round

No more no more no more of that jazz&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Hello again my beauties
Is it happening?
Is everybody ok?
Wanna fool around?

It's so easy, but I can't do it
So risky - but I gotta chance it
So funny, there's nothing to laugh about
My money, that's all you wanna talk about
I can see what you want me to be
I'm no fool

It's in the lap of the Gods - sing it
Wo wo la la la wo
Wo wo la la woh woh wooh
I'm no fool

Woh woh la la wo wo ooh
Wo wo la la la wo
Wo wo la la
Woh wo woo

Woh woh la la la wo
Wo wo la la woh woh wooh
I'm no fool&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Just look at all those hungry mouths we have to feed
Take a look at all the suffering we breed
So many lonely faces scattered all around
Searching for what they need

Is this the world we created...?
We made it all our own
Is this the world we invaded
Against the law
So it seems in the end
Is this what we're all living for today
The world that we created

You know that everyday a helpless child is born
Who needs some loving care inside a happy home
Somewhere a wealthy man is sitting on his throne
Waiting for life to go by

Wooh, is this the world we created...?
We made it all our own
Is this the world we devastated
Right to the bone
If there's a God up in the sky looking down
What must he think of what we've done
To the world that he created&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Okay, we're gonna fool around a bit, come on

You don't like crazy things
You don't like rockin' baby
You just wanna go to the movie show
Sit there holdin' hands
You're so square (baby I don't care)
Do wop, do wop
Do wop, do wop

I don't ???? (do wop)
I don't ???? (do wop)
I only wanna love you baby
I guess it's just because
You're so square (baby I don't care)

Do wop, do wop
Do wop, do wop

I don't need ??? dances
But I do

????
???
I do I do I do

I don't like crazy things (do wop)
I don't like rockin' baby (do wop)
I just wanna go to a movie show
Sit there holdin' hands
You're so square
Baby I don't care (do wop, do wop)
Baby I don't care (do wop, do wop)
Baby I don't care (do wop, do wop)

&lt;lyrics&gt;Okay, this is a Ricky Nelson song

I say hello Mary Lou (goodbye heart)
Sweet Mary Lou I'm so in love with you
I knew Mary Lou we'd never part
So hello Mary Lou (goodbye heart)

You passed me by one sunny day
Flashed those big brown eyes my way
Ooh, I wanted you forever more
Hey, I'm not one that get's around
Swear my feet stuck to the ground
And though I never did see you no more
Yeah neah

I said hello Mary Lou (goodbye heart)
Sweet Mary Lou I'm so in love with you
Hey, I knew Mary Lou we'd never part
So hello Mary Lou (goodbye heart)
So hello Mary Lou (goodbye heart)
One more time
Yes, hello Mary Lou (goodbye heart)

Hey, wait a minute
One minute
Ah, I need my fucking water
I don't care, let's go

Right, give us the right key for fuck's sake&lt;/lyrics&gt;

I could see you were of distinction
A real big spender
Good looking, so refined
Say wouldn't you like to know what's going on in my mind

Hey big spender
Spend a little time with me&lt;/lyrics&gt;

== Studio Version ==

&lt;lyrics&gt;
I was told a million times
Of all the troubles in my way
That I should grow a little wiser
A little better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers
And I rode a million miles
Well I'd still be where I started
Bread and butter for a smile
I sold a million mirrors
In a shop in alley way
But I never saw my face
In any window any day
Now they say your folks are telling you
Be a superstar
But I tell you just be satisfied
To stay right where you are

Keep yourself alive, yeah
Keep yourself alive
Take you all your time and your money
Put it to survive

Well I loved a million women
In a belladonic haze
And I ate a million dinners
Brought to me on silver trays
Give me everything I need
Feed my body and my soul
Well I grow a little bigger
Maybe that can be my goal
I was told a million times
Of all the people in my way
How I had to keep on trying
And get better ev'ry day
But if I crossed a million rivers
And I rode a million miles
Well I'd still be where I started
Same as when I started

Keep yourself alive, come on
Keep yourself alive
Ooh, take you all your time and your money
Put it to survive

Keep yourself alive, waoh
Keep yourself alive
Aah, take you all your time and the money
To keep me satisfied

Do you think you're better every day?
No, I just think I'm two steps nearer to my grave

Keep yourself alive, come on
Keep yourself alive
Mm you take your time and take my money
To keep yourself alive

Keep yourself alive, come on
Keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive

Keep yourself alive, come on come on
Keep yourself alive
Take you all your time and the money
To keep me satisfied

Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive

...&lt;/lyrics&gt;

== Live Version ==

&lt;lyrics&gt;
Eh everybody c'mon clap your hands - do it
Keep yourself, keep yourself, keep yourself alive
Keep yourself, keep yourself, keep yourself alive oh baby
Alright everybody
Keep yourself alive ooh yea
Everybody keep yourself alive go go

I was told a million times
Of all the troubles in my way
To grow a little wiser
Little better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers
And I rode a million miles
Still be where I started
Bread and butter for a smile
Sold a million mirrors
In a shop in alley way
But I never saw my face
In any window any day
Now they say your folks are telling you
Be a super star
Tell you just be satisfied
To stay right where you are

Keep yourself alive Keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive - do it yeah
Alright - go go go

Well I loved a million women
In a belladonic haze
And I ate a million dinners
Brought to me on silver trays
Give me everything I need
Feed my body and my soul
Grow a little bigger
Maybe that can be my goal
Told a million times
Of all the people in my way
How I had to keep on trying
And get better ev'ry day
But if I crossed a million rivers
Rode a million miles

Keep yourself alive keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive - shake it, eh

&lt;lyrics&gt;This is called spread your wings

Sammy was low
Just watching the show
Over and over again
He knew it was time
He'd made up his mind
To leave his dead life behind
His boss said to him
&quot;Boy you'd better begin
To get those crazy notions right out of your head
Sammy who do you think that you are?
You should've been sweeping up the Emerald bar&quot;

Spread your wings and fly away - sing it
Fly away, far away
Spread your little wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Pull yourself together
'Cos you know you should do better
That's because you're a free man

He spends his evenings alone in his hotel room
Keeping his thoughts to himself, he'd be leaving soon
Wishing he was miles and miles and miles away
Nothing in this world, nothing could make him stay

Since he was small
He had no luck at all
Nothing came easy to him
Now it was time
He'd made up his mind
&quot;This could be my last chance&quot;
His boss said to him
&quot;Now listen boy!
You're always dreaming
You've got no real ambition, you won't get very far
Sammy who, who do you think you are?
You should've been sweeping up the Emerald bar?&quot;

So honey

Spread your wings (c'mon) and fly away - that's good
Fly away
Far away
Far away
Oh, spread your little wings and fly away, hey
Fly away, far away
Oh pull yourself together
'Cos you know you know you know you know
You know you should do better
That's because you're a free man

So c'mon honey

You feeling alright?
Hey hey
Eh eh&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Alright, we're gonna do something a bit special tonight
This is called Brighton rock
Ha ha ha ha ow

Mm, happy little day, Jimmy went away
Met his little Jenny on a public holiday
A happy pair they made, so decorously laid
'Neath the gay illuminations all along the promenade
&quot;It's so good to know there's still a little magic in the air
I'll weave my spell&quot;

&quot;Jenny will you stay - tarry with me pray
Nothing 'ere need come between us tell me love, what do you say&quot;
&quot;Oh no I must away to my mum in disarray
If my mother should discover how I spent my holiday
It would be of no avail to talk of magic in the air
I'll weave my spell&quot;

O rock of ages, do not crumble, love is breathing still
O lady moon, shine down a little people magic if you will

Eh
Ma ma ma ma ma ma yeah
Eh eh eh

Jenny pines away, writes a letter everyday
&quot;We must ever be together, nothing can my love erase&quot;
&quot;Oh no I'm compromised, I must apologize
If my mother should discover how I spent my holidays...&quot;
Oooh oh oh oh
Ooh yeah&lt;/lyrics&gt;

Turn on the TV let it drip right down in your eyes

Hey hey hey hey, It was the DNA

Do you know, do you know, do you know, just how I feel?

Artist: [[Queen]]&lt;br&gt;
Album: [[Queen:Live Magic (1986)|Live Magic]]
----

&lt;lyrics&gt;
Just look at all those hungry mouths we have to feed
Take a look at all suffering we breed
So many lonely faces scattered all around
Searching for what they need

Is this the world we created?
We made it on our own
Is this the world we devastated?
Right to the bone
If there's a God up in the sky
Looking down, what must he think of what we've done
To the world that he created?
&lt;/lyrics&gt;

The sun is shining

And no-one's gonna to stop me now, oh yeah

It's a beautiful day
I feel good, I feel right
And no-one, no-one's gonna stop me now, mama

Sometimes I feel so sad, so sad, so bad
But no-one's gonna stop me now, no-one
It's hopeless, so hopeless to even try&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I don't want to sleep with you
I don't need the passion too
I don't want a stormy affair
To make me feel my life is heading somewhere
All I want is the comfort and care
Just to know that my woman gives me sweet
Mother love ah ha

I've walked too long in this lonely lane
I've had enough of this same old game
I'm a man of the world and they say that I'm strong
But my heart is heavy, and my hope is gone

Out in the city, in the cold world outside
I don't want pity, just a safe place to hide
Mama please, let me back inside

I don't want to make no waves
But you can give me all the love that I crave
I can't take it if you see me cry
I long for peace before I die
All I want is to know that you're there
You're gonna give me all your sweet
Mother love ah ha (mother love)

My body's aching, but I can't sleep
My dreams are all the company I keep
Got such a feeling as the sun goes down
I'm coming home to my sweet
Mother love

(Mother love mother love love love love love)
God works in mysterious ways
Eeeeh dop, de dop, dep dop
I think I'm goin' back to the things I learnt so well in my youth&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;This is where we are today
People going separate ways
This is the way things are now
In disarray
I read it in the papers
There's death on every page
Oh Lord, I thank the Lord above
My life has been saved, eaah eah

Here we go
Tellin' lies
Here we go - here we go

We're right back where we started from
People going separate ways
This is the way things are now
In disarray - hey
I read it in the papers
There's death on every page
Aah - oh Lord, I thank you from above
My life has been saved
Ooh ooh ooh ooh my life

Ooh my my life

&lt;lyrics&gt;It's winter-fall
Read skies are gleaming, oh
Sea-gulls are flyin' over
Swans are floatin' by
Smoking chimney-tops
Am I dreaming
Am I dreaming...?

The nights draw in
There's a silky moon up in the sky, yeah
Children are fantasising
Grown-ups are standin' by
What a super feeling
Am I dreaming
Am I dreaming...?
Woh-woh-woh-woh

(Dreaming) So quiet and peaceful
(Dreaming) Tranquil and blissful
(Dreaming) There's a kind of magic in the air
(Dreaming) What a truly magnificent view
(Dreaming) A breathtaking scene
With the dreams of the world
In the palm of your hand

(Dreaming) A cosy fireside chat
(Dreaming) A little this, a little that
(Dreaming) Sound of merry laughter skippin' by
(Dreaming) Gentle rain beatin' on my face
(Dreaming) What an extraordinary place!
And the dream of the child
Is the hope of the, hope of the man

It's all so beautiful
Like a landscape painting in the sky, yeah
Mountains are zoomin' higher, uh
Little girls scream an' cry
My world is spinnin' and spinnin' and spinnin'
It's unbelievable
Sends me reeling
Am I dreaming
Am I dreaming...?

Oooh - it's bliss&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;(Memories, my memories)
(How long can you stay)
(To haunt my days)

She came without a farthing
A babe without a name
So much ado 'bout nothing
Is what she'd try to say
So much ado my lover
So many games we played
Through every fleeted summer
Through every precious day

All dead, all dead
All the dreams we had
And I wonder why I still live on
All dead, all dead
And alone I'm spared
My sweeter half instead
All dead
And gone
All dead...

All dead, all dead
At the rainbow's end
And still I hear her own sweet song
All dead, all dead
Take me back again
You know my little friend's
All dead
And gone

Her ways are always with me
I wander all the while
But please you must forgive me
I am old but still a child

All dead, all dead
But I should not grieve
In time it comes to everyone
All dead, all dead
But in hope I breathe
Of course I don't believe
You're dead
And gone
All dead
And gone&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Hey you boy, hey you
Hey you boy, think that you know what you're doing
You think you're gonna set things to rights
You're just another picture on a teenage wall
You're just another sucker ready for a fall

You gotta fight from the inside
Attack from the rear
Fight from the inside
You can't win with your hands tied
Fight from the inside
Ooh, ooh, aah
Fight from the inside
Right down the line

Hey you boy, hey you
Hey you boy, think that you know what you're doing
You think that out in the streets is all true
You're just another, monney-spinner tool
You're just another, fool

You gotta fight from the inside
Attack from the rear
Fight from the inside
You can't win with your hands tied
Fight from the inside

Fight from the inside

Right down the line&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;One, two, three
I was nothin' but a city boy
My trumpet was my only toy
I've been blowin' my horn
Since I knew I was born
But there ain't no nobody wants to know

I've been sleepin' on the sidewalk
Rollin' down the road
I may get hungry
But I sure don't want to go home

So round the corner comes a limousine
And the biggest grin I ever seen
Hey, sonny won't you sign
Right along the dotted line
What you sayin' are you playin'
Sure you don't mean me?

I've been sleepin' on the sidewalk
Rollin' down the road
I may get hungry
But I sure don't wanna go home

Now I'll tell you what happened...

They took me to a room without a table
They said &quot;Blow your trumpet into here&quot;
I played around as well as I was able
And soon we had the record of the year

I was a legend all through the land
I was blowin' to a million fans
Nothin' was a-missin'
All the people want to listen
You'd have thought I was a happy man

And I was sleepin' like a princess
Never touch the road
I don't get hungry
And I sure don't want to go home

Have to have some fun...

And now they tell me that I ain't so fashionable
And that I owe the man a million bucks a year
So I told 'em where to stick the fancy label
It's just me and the road from here
Yeah, yeah

I'm back to playin' and layin'
I'm back on the game

And I'm sleepin' on the sidewalk
Rollin' down the road
I sure get hungry and I sure do wanna go home
Yeah&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I make it half past six you come at seven
Always trying to keep me, hanging round
You little spoilt thing, girl you kept me waiting
Never contemplating my point of view
This comes as no surprise
I'm a fool, for I believed your lies
But now I've seen through your disguise
Who needs, well I don't need, who needs you?

Ok, aah

Oh I believed you
Went on my knees to you
How I trusted you
But you turned me down
But it's dog eat dog in this rat race
And it leaves you bleeding lying flat on your face
Reaching out, reaching out for a helping hand
Where is that helping hand?

Oh mucho, I like it, I like it, mmm, ooh, well I don't need you

How I was pushed around
&quot;Don't let it get you down&quot;
You walked all over me
&quot;But don't you ever give in&quot;
Taking one step forward, slipping two steps back
There's an empty feeling that you can't forget
Reaching out (reaching out) for a helping hand (for a helping hand)

When I met you, you were always charming
Couldn't sleep at night till you were mine
You were oh so so sophisticated
Never interested in what I'd say
I had to swallow my pride
So naive, you took me for a ride
But now I'm the one to decide
Who needs, well I don't need, who needs you?&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;&lt;tt&gt;(Scene 1)&lt;/tt&gt;
You say you love me
And I hardly know your name
And if I say I love you in the candle light
There's no-one but myself to blame
But there's something inside
That's turning my mind away
Woh - how I could love you
If I could let you stay

It's late - and I'm bleeding deep inside
It's late - ooh, is it just my sickly pride?
Too late - even now the feeling seems to steal away
So late - though I'm crying I can't help but hear you say
It's late - It's late - It's late
But not too late

&lt;tt&gt;(Scene 2)&lt;/tt&gt;
Mmm, yeah
The way you love me
Is the sweetest love around
But after all this time
The more I'm trying
The more I seem to let you down, yes
Now you tell me you're leaving
And I just can't believe it's true
Oh, you know that I can love you
Though I know I can't be true
Oh, you made me love you
Don't tell me that we're through

It's late - mmm, and it's driving me so mad
It's late - yes I know, but don't try and tell me that it's
Too late - save our love you can't turn out the light
So late - I've been wrong but I'll learn to be right
It's late - It's late - It's late
But not too late

- Mmm, I've been so long
- You've been so long
- We've been so long tryin' to work it out
- I ain't got long
- You ain't got long
- We've gotta know what this life's all about, ooh
- Tell me
- Tryin' to work it out, yeah, ooh
- ooh too late, yeah, too late, much too late, aaah

&lt;tt&gt;(Scene 3)&lt;/tt&gt;
You're staring at me
With suspicion in your eye
You say what game are you playing?
What's this that you're saying?
I know that I can't reply
If I take you tonight
Is it making my life a lie?
Oh you make me wonder
Did I live my life right?

It's late - ooh, but it's time to set me free
It's late - ooh, yes I know, but there's no way it has to be
Too late - so let the fire take our bodies this night
So late - let the waters take our guilt in the tide
It's late - It's late - It's late - It's late
It's late - It's late - It's late
Oh, It's all too late

Woah, woah, c'mon
Ooh m m m m late too late oh yeah
Waaa&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Another party's over
And I'm left cold sober
My baby left me for somebody new
I don't wanna talk about it
Want to forget about it
Wanna be intoxicated with that special brew
So come and get me
Let me
Get in that sinking feeling
That says my heart is on an all time low - so
Don't expect me
To behave perfectly
And wear that sunny smile
My guess is I'm in for a cloudy and overcast
Don't try and stop me
'Cause I'm heading for that stormy weather soon
I'm causing a mild sensation
With this new occupation
I'm permanently glued
To this extraordinary mood, so now move over
And let me take over
With my melancholy blues

I'm causing a mild sensation
With this new occupation
I'm in the news
I'm just getting used to my new exposure
Come into my enclosure
And meet my melancholy blues&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Yesterday my life was in ruin
Now today I know what I'm doing
Gotta feeling I should be doing all right
Doing all right

Where will I be this time tomorrow
Jump in joy or sinking in sorrow
Anyway I should be doing all right
Doing all right

Should be waiting for the sun
Looking round to find the words to say
Should be waiting for the skies to clear
There a time in all the world
Should be waiting for the sun
And anyway I've got hide away

Ah ah ah ah
Yesterday my life was in ruin
Now today God knows what I'm doing
Anyway I should be doing all right
Doing all right

Doing all right
&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Great King Rat died today
Born on the twenty first of May
Died syphilis forty four on his birthday
Every second word he swore
Yes he was the son of a whore
Always wanted by the law

Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know people?
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you
Would you like to see?

Now hear this
Where will I be tomorrow?
Will I beg?, Will I borrow?
I don't care, I don't care anyway
Come on, come on the time is right
The man is evil and that is right
I told you ah yes I told you
And that's no lie oh no no

Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you
Would you like to see?
Show me

Oooh oooh oooh oooh
Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know people people?
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you
Would you like to see?

Hit it

Now listen all you people
Put out the good and keep the bad
Don't believe all you read in the bible
You sinners get in line
Saints you leave far behind
Very soon you're gonna be his disciple

Don't listen to what mama says
Not a word - not a word mama says
Or else you'll find yourself being the rival
Sure, the great lord before he died
Knelt sinners by his side
And said you're going to realise tomorrow, oh woh oh woh oh woh

No I'm not going to tell you
What you already know
'Cause time and time again
The old man said it all a long time ago
Come on come on the time is right
This evil man will fight
I told you once before

Hear it
No

Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Just like I said before
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
The last time I tell you
Would you like to see?&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Aah, aah
In the land where horses born with eagle wings
And honey bees have lost their stings
There's singing forever, ooh yeah
Lion's den with fallow deer
And rivers made from wine so clear
Flow on and on forever
Dragons fly like sparrows thru' the air
And baby lambs where Samson dares
To go on on on on on on

My fairy king can see things
He rules the air and turns the tides
That are not there for you and me
Ooh yeah he guides the winds
My fairy king can do right and nothing wrong

Ah, then came man to savage in the night
To run like thieves and to kill like knives
To take away the power from the magic hand
To bring about the ruin to the promised land, aah, aah

They turn the milk into sour
Like the blue in the blood of my veins
Why can't you see it
Fire burning in hell with the cry of screaming pain
Son of heaven set me free and let me go
Sea turn dry no salt from sand
Seasons fly no helping hand
Teeth don't shine like pearls for poor man's eyes, aah

Someone someone has drained the colour from my wings
Broken my fairy circle ring
And shamed the king in all his pride
Changed the winds and wronged the tides
Mother Mercury Mercury
Look what they've done to me
I cannot run I cannot hide
La la la la la la la la la la la la&lt;/lyrics&gt;

And I could see the sun breakin'
Lucy was high and so was I dazzling
Holding the world inside
Once I believed in everyone
Everyone and anyone can see

Oh oh the night comes down
And I get afraid of losing my way
Oh oh the night comes down
Oooh and it's dark again

Once I could laugh with everyone
Once I could see the good in me
The black and the white distinctively colouring
Holding the world inside
Now all the world is grey to me
Nobody can see - you gotta believe it

Oh (oh) oh (oh) the night comes down
And I get afraid of losing my way
Oh oh the night comes down
Oooh and it's dark again
And it's dark again
And it's dark again&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Had to make do with a worn out rock and roll scene
The old bop is getting tired need a rest
Well you know what I mean
Fifty eight that was great
But it's over now and that's all
Something harder's coming up
Gonna really knock a hole in the wall
Gonna hit ya grab ya hard
Make you feel ten feet tall

Well I hope that this baby's gonna come along soon
You don't know it could happen any old rainy afternoon
With the temperature down
And the jukebox blowing no fuse
And my musical life's feeling
Like a long Sunday school cruise
And you know there's one thing
Every single body could use
Yeah listen to me baby
Let me tell you what it's all about
Modern times rock and roll
Modern times rock and roll

Get your high heeled guitar style boots and some groovy clothes
Get a hair piece on your chest
And a ring through your nose
Find a nice little man who says
He's gonna make you a real big star
Stars in your eyes ants in your pants
Think you should go far
Everybody in this bum sucking world's
Gonna know who you are
Look out&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I want you woman
Tried to be a son and daughter rolled into one
You said you'd equal any man for having your fun
Ooh, now didn't you feel surprised to find
The cap just didn't fit?
The world expects a man
To buckle down and shovel shit
What'll you do for loving
When it's only just begun?
I want you to be a woman

Tried to be a teacher and a fisher of men
An equal people preacher
Will you lead us all the same?
Ooh, well I travelled around the world
And found a brand new word for day
Ooh, watching the time mustn't linger behind
Pardon me I have to get away
What'll you think of heaven
If it's back from where you came
I want you to be a woman
I want you to be a woman
Yeah
Gotta save the world
Ooh, I've just begun
Alright&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;And then I saw him in the crowd
A lot of people had gathered round him
The beggars shouted, the lepers called him
The old man said nothing
He just stared about him
All going down to see the lord Jesus
All going down (going down) to see the lord Jesus
All going down

Then came a man before his feet he fell
Unclean said the leper, rang his bell
Felt the palm of a hand touch his head
Go now, go now you're a new man instead
All going down (going down) to see the lord Jesus
All going down to see the lord Jesus - alright
All going down

It all began with the three wise men
Followed a star took them to Bethlehem
And made it heard throughout the land
Born was the leader of man
All going down (going down) to see the lord Jesus
All going down (going down to Bethlehem) to see the lord Jesus
All going down

It all began with the three wise men
Followed a star took them to Bethlehem
And made it heard throughout the land
Born was the leader of man
Yes we're all going down to see the lord Jesus
All going down to see the lord Jesus
All going down&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;A word in your ear, from father to son
Hear the word that I say
I fought with you, fought on your side
Long before you were born

Joyful the sound, the word goes around
From father to son, to son...
And the voice is so clear, time after time it keeps on
Calling you, calling you on
Don't destroy what you see, your country to be
Just keep building on the ground that's been won

Kings will be crowned, and the word goes around
From father to son, to son

Won't you hear us sing
(te de de de de de de de de de de de de de de)
Our family song
(te de de de de de de de de de de de de de de)

Father, father, father, father, ooh yeah, father, father, father, father
(te de de de de de de de de de de de de de de)
Now we hand it on
But I've heard it all before

Take this letter that I give you
Take it sonny, hold it high
You won't understand a word that's in it
But you'll write it out again before you die (yeah yeah)

A word in your ear from father to son
Funny you don't hear a single word I say
But my letter to you will stay by your side
Through the years till the loneliness is gone
Sing if you will - but the air you breathe I live to give you

Father to son, father to, father to, father to son

Joyful the sound, the word goes around
From father to son, to son...

Kings will be crowned, the word goes around
From father to son, to son

Joyful the sound, the word goes around
From father to son, to son...

Kings will be crowned, the word goes around
From father to son, to son

Joyful the sound, the word goes around
From father to son, to son...

Kings will be crowned, the word goes around
From father to son, to son

Joyful the sound, the word goes around&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;So sad her eyes
Smiling dark eyes
So sad her eyes
As it began

On such a breathless night as this
Upon my brow the lightest kiss
I walked alone
And all around the air did say
My lady soon will stir this way
In sorrow known
The White Queen walks and the night grows pale
Stars of lovingness in her hair

Needing - unheard
Pleading - one word
So sad my eyes
She cannot see

How did thee fare, what have thee seen
The mother of the willow green
I call her name
And 'neath her window have I stayed
I loved the footsteps that she made
And when she came
White Queen how my heart did ache
And dry my lips no word would make
So still I wait

My Goddess hear my darkest fear
I speak too late
It's for evermore that I wait

Dear friend goodbye
No tears in my eyes
So sad it ends
As it began&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;You never heard my song before the music was too loud
But now I think you hear me well for now we both know how
No star can light our way in this cloud of dark and fear
But some day one day...

Funny how the pages turn and hold us in between
A misty castle awaits for you
And you shall be a Queen (you shall be a Queen)
Today the cloud it hangs over us and all is grey
But some day one day...

When I was you and you were me and we were very young
Together took us nearly there, the rest may not be sung
So still the cloud it hangs over us and we're alone
But some day one day...
We'll come home&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Mama's gotta problem
She don't know what to say
Her little baby boy has just left home today
She's got to be the loser in the end
She's got to be the loser in the end
Misuse her and you'll lose her as a friend
She's Ma on whom you can always depend, ooh hoo

She washed and fed, and clothed and cared
For nearly twenty years
And all she gets is &quot;goodbye Ma&quot;
And the night times for her tears
She's got to be the loser in the end
She's got to be the loser in the end
Misuse her and you'll lose her as a friend (yeah)
She's Ma on whom you can always depend, ooh hoo ooh ooh ooh

We'll hear ya talkin' now

So listen mothers everywhere
To just one mother's son
You'll get forgotten all the way
If you don't let them have their fun
Forget regrets, and just remember
It's not so long since you were young

You're bound to be the loser in the end
You're bound to be the loser in the end
They'll choose their new shoes, that's not far to bend
You're Ma on whom they can always depend, ooh hoo ooh ooh ooh&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Faa fa fa fa fa
Fa fa fa fa faa
Now once upon a time - an old man told me a fable
When the piper is gone - and the soup is cold on your table
And if the black crow flies to find a new destination
That is the sign
Come tonight
Come to the ogre sight
Come to the ogre-battle-fight

He gives a great big cry and he can swallow up the ocean
With a mighty tongue he catches flies - the palm of a hand incredible size
One great big eye - has a focus in your direction
Now the battle is on
Yeah yeah yeah
Come tonight
Come to the ogre sight
Come to the ogre-battle-fight

Fa fa fa fa faa
Hoooa

The ogre-men are still inside
The two-way mirror mountain
You gotta keep down right out of sight
You can't see in, but they can see out
&quot;Ooh keep a look out&quot;
The ogre-men are coming out
From the two-way mirror mountain
They're running up behind and they're coming all about
Can't go east 'cos you gotta go south

Aaargh
Aaaaaaaarghh
Ogre-men are going home
The great big fight is over
Bugle blow, let trumpet cry
Ogre battle lives for ever more - oh oh oh
You can come along
You can come along
Come to ogre battle
Fa fa fa fa faa&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;He's a Fairy Feller
The fairy folk have gathered round the new-moon shine
To see the Feller crack a nut at night's noon-time
To swing his axe he swears, as it climbs he dares
To deliver...
The master-stroke

Ploughman, &quot;Waggoner Will&quot;, and types
Politician with senatorial pipe - he's a dilly-dally-o
Pedagogue squinting, wears a frown
And a satyr peers under lady's gown, dirty fellow
What a dirty laddio
Tatterdemalion and a junketer
There's a thief and a dragonfly trumpeter - he's my hero, aah

Fairy dandy tickling the fancy of his lady friend
The nymph in yellow &quot;can we see the master-stroke&quot;
What a quaere fellow

Soldier, sailor, tinker, tailer, ploughboy
Waiting to hear the sound
And the arch-magician presides
He is the leader
Oberon and Titania watched by the harridan
Mab is the Queen and there's a good apothecary-man
Come to say hello
Fairy dandy tickling the fancy of his lady friend
The nymph in yellow
What a quaere fellow
The ostler stands with hands on his knees
Come on Mr. Feller, crack it open if you please&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;There's no living in my life anymore
The seas have gone dry and the rain stopped falling
Please don't you cry anymore
Can't you see
Listen to the breeze, whisper to me please
Don't send me to the path of nevermore

Even the valleys below
Where the rays of the sun were so warm and tender
Now haven't anything to grow
Can't you see?
(nevermore nevermore)
Why did you have to leave me?
(nevermore nevermore)
Why did you deceive me?
You send me to the path of nevermore
When you say you didn't love me anymore
Aah aaah
Nevermore, aah
Nevermore&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Do you mean it?
Do you mean it?
Do you mean it?
Why don't you mean it?
Why do I follow you and where do you go
Aah aah aah aah aah aah

You've never seen nothing like it no never in your life
Like going up to heaven and then coming back alive
Let me tell you all about it
And the world will so allow it
Ooh give me a little time to choose
Water babies singing in a lily-pool delight
Blue powder monkeys praying in the dead of night

Here comes the Black Queen, poking in the pile
Fie-fo the black Queen, marching single file
Take this, take that, bring them down to size
March to the Black Queen

Put them in the cellar with the naughty boys
A little nigger sugar then a rub-a-dub-a baby oil
(Aah aah) black on (aah aah), black on every finger nail and toe
We've only begun - begun
Make this, make that, keep making all that noise
March to the Black Queen
Now I've got a belly-full
You can be my sugar-baby, you can be my honey-chile, yes

La laa la laa la laa la laa la la la la la laa
La laa la laa la laa la laa la laa la laa la laa la laa
A voice from behind me reminds me
(Tra la laa tra la laa aaah)
Spread out your wings you are an angel
Remember to deliver with the speed of light
A little bit of love and joy
Everything you do (will bear a will) bears a will and a why and a wherefore
A little bit of love and joy
In each and every soul lies a man, very soon he'll deceive and discover
But even till the end of his life, he'll bring a little love

Aah ah aah
La la la la laa
Ah ah ah ah aah
Ah la la la laa
I reign with my left hand, I rule with my right
I'm lord of all darkness, I'm Queen of the night
I've got the power - now do the march of the Black Queen
My life is in your hands, I'll fo and I'll fie
I'll be what you make me, I'll do what you like
I'll be a bad boy - I'll be your bad boy - I'll do the march of the Black Queen

Ah aah ah aah
Ah aah ah aah
Walking true to style
She's vulgar 'buse and vile
Fie-fo the Black Queen, tattoos all her pies
She boils and she bakes, and she never dots her &quot;I's&quot;

She's our leader
La la la la laa la la laa
La la la la la laa

Forget your singalongs and your lullabies
Surrender to the city of the fireflies
Dance with the devil in beat with the band
To hell with all of you hand-in-hand
But now it's time to be gone
(La la la laaa) forever - forever
La la la laaa aaah aah aah aaah&lt;/lyrics&gt;

Tomorrow brings love in the shape of things

That's what love is, that's what love is

Funny how love can break your heart so suddenly
Funny how love came tumbling down with Adam and Eve
Funny how love is running wild and feeling free
Funny how love is coming home in time for tea

Funny how love is anywhere you're bound to be (dah dah)
Funny how love is every song in every key
Funny how love is when you gotta hurry home 'cos you're late for tea
(Aah aah aah aah aah aah)
Funny, funny, funny, oh
Tomorrow comes, tomorrow brings
Tomorrow brings love in the shape of things
At any time (any time), anywhere (anywhere)

&lt;lyrics&gt;I can't live without you
I can't live without you
I can't live without you
I can't live without you
I can't live without you
I can't live without you
Oh Ohhh
I Can't
Yeah
I can't live with you
But I can't live without you
I can't let you stay
Oooh, but I can't live if you go away
I don't know just how it goes
All I know is I can't live with you

Yeah, I'm having a hard time
I'm walking a fine line
Between hope and despair
You may think that I don't care
But I travelled a long road to
Get a hold of my sorrow
I tried to catch a dream
But nothing's what it seems
Love is saying baby it's all right
When deep inside you're really petrified
Lover turns to hater
On this escalator
I can't live with you
Yeah, but I can't live without you
I can't breathe - if you stay
But I can't bear you to go away
I don't know what time it is
All I know is I can't live with you

We're stuck in a bad place
We're trapped in a rat race
And we can't escape
Maybe there's been some mistake
We're trying to make a high score
We're walking through a closed door
And nobody's winning
We're just sinning against ourselves
Hold on baby tell me it's all right
Anger's breaking from the hurt inside
Passions screaming hotter
Doin' what we gotta do - yeah
I can't live with you, I can't live with you
I can't live, I can't live
I can't, I can't live with you
But baby I'll never ever leave you

I can't live with you
But I can't live without you
Cause I'm in love with you
Ooh, and everything about you
I can't live with you
No I just can't live, I just can't live
Ooh, I can't live with you
Yeah, and I can't live without you
Through the madness, through the tears
We've still got each other
For a million years

Yeah, ooh yeah, yeah
I can't live without you - eh yeah
I can't live without you
Yeah eah yeah
Whoa whooooa
I can't live without you
I can't live without you
I can't live without you
Whoa
I can't live without you
Baby baby baby
I can't live without you
I can't live without you
Ma ma ma ma ma whoa whoooa yeah
Yeah&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Sleeping very soundly on a Saturday morning I was dreaming I was Al Capone
There's a rumour going round, gotta clear outta town
Yes smelling like a dry fish bone
Here come the law, gonna break down the door, gonna carry me away once more
Never, I never, I never want it any more
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor
Crazy
Stone cold crazy, you know

Wooh
Ow

Rainy afternoon I gotta blow a typhoon and I'm playing on my slide trombone
Anymore, anymore, cannot take it anymore

Gotta get away from this stone cold floor
Crazy
Stone cold crazy, you know, ow, hit 'em on

Walking down the street, shooting people that I meet
With my rubber tommy water gun
Here come the deputy, he's gonna come and getta me
I gotta get me get up and run
They got the sirens loose
I ran right outta juice
They're gonna put me in a cell, if I can't go to heaven
Will they let me go to hell
Crazy
Stone cold crazy, you know
Ow
&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;My new purple shoes, bin' amazing the people next door
And my rock 'n' roll 45's, bin' enraging the folks on the lower floor

I got a way with the girls on my block
Try my best be a real individual
And when we go down to smokies and rock
They line up like it's some kinda ritual

Ooh give me a good guitar, and you can say that my hair's a disgrace
Or, just find me an open car, I'll make the speed of light outta this place

Mmm, I like the good things in life
But most of the best things ain't free
Some same situation, justs cuts like a knife
When you're young, and you're poor, and you're crazy, crazy
Young and you're crazy
Young and you're crazy
Young and you're crazy

But ooh give me a good guitar and you can say that my hair's a disgrace
Or, just find me an open car, I'll make the speed of light outta this place&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Dislocate your spine if you don't sign he says
I'll have you seeing double (double)
Mesmerise you when he's tongue-tied
Simply with those eyes, ooh ooh ooh
Synchronise your minds and see
The beast within him rise

Don't look back
Don't look back
It's a rip-off
Flick of the wrist and you're dead baby
Blow him a kiss and you're mad, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Flick of the wrist, he'll eat your heart out
A dig in the ribs and then a kick in the head
He's taken an arm and taken a leg
All this time honey
Baby you've been had

Intoxicate your brain with what I'm saying
If not you'll lie in knee-deep trouble
Prostitute yourself he says
Castrate your human pride, ooh ooh ooh
Sacrifice your leisure days
Let me squeeze you till you've dried

Don't look back
Don't look back
It's a rip-off, aah, aah, aah

Work my fingers to my bones
I scream with pain
I still make no impression
Seduce you with his money-make machine
Cross-collateralize, (big-time money money)
Reduce you to a muzak-fake machine
Then the last goodbye
It's a rip-off

Flick of the wrist and you're dead baby
Blow him a kiss and you're mad, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Flick of the wrist, he'll eat your heart out
A dig in the ribs and then a kick in the head
He's taken an arm, and taken a leg
All this time honey
Baby you've been

&lt;lyrics&gt;I am forever searching high and low
But why does everybody tell me no
Neptune of the seas have you an answer for me please
The lily of the valley doesn't know

I lie in wait with open eyes
I carry on through stormy skies
I follow every course
My kingdom for a horse
But each time I grow old
Serpent of the Nile
Relieve me for a while
And cast me from your spell - let me go

Messenger from seven seas has flown
To tell the king of Rhye he's lost his throne
Wars will never cease
Is there time enough for peace
But the lily of the valley doesn't grow&lt;/lyrics&gt;

Think all my thoughts with you, and only you
Anything you ask I do, for you

But in the end
I leave it to the lords
Leave it in the lap of the Gods
What more can I do?

Leave it in the lap of the Gods
I leave it to you
Leave it in the lap of the Gods
Leave it in the lap of the Gods

Only tears to dwell upon
I dare not say as the wind must blow
So a love is lost, a love is won
Go to sleep and dream again
Soon your hopes will rise and then
From all this gloom life can start anew
And there'll be no crying soon&lt;/lyrics&gt;

It's always hit or miss, so take your aim
Got to hold on tight, shoot me out of sight

Ooh, don't you misfire
Fill me up
With the desire
To carry on, oooh, ah, oooh, ah

Don't you misfire
Fill me up
With the desire
To carry on

Your gun is loaded, and pointing my way
There's only one bullet, so don't delay
Got to time it right, fire me through the night
Come on take a shot
Fire me higher
Don't you miss this time
Please don't misfire, misfire&lt;/lyrics&gt;

Bet your bottom dollar bill you're a playboy - yeah, yeah
Daddy cool with a ninety dollar smile, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
Took my money out of gratitude
And he git right outta town - babe

I gotta getty up, steady up, shoot him down
Gotta hit that latitude - babe

Bring back, bring back
Bring back that Leroy Brown - yeah
Bring back, bring back
Gotta bring that Leroy Brown - back

Big bad Leroy Brown he got no common sense - no, no
He got no brains but he sure gotta lot of style
Can't stand no more in this here jail
I gotta rid myself of this sentence

Gotta get me out the heat, step into the shade
Gotta get me there dead or alive - babe

Wooh, wooh, big bad Leroy, wooh, wooh
Wooh, wooh, big bad Leroy - brown - well

Bring back, bring back
Bring back that Leroy Brown
Bring back, bring back
Gotta bring that Leroy Brown - back

Big mama Lulu Belle she had a nervous breakdown
(she had a nervous breakdown)
Leroy's taken her honey chile away
But she met him down at the station (wooh wooh)
Put a shot gun to his head
And unless I be mistaken
This is what she said
&quot;Big bad, big boy, big bad Leroy Brown
I'm gonna get that cutie pie&quot;

Bring back, bring back
Bring back that Leroy Brown - yeah

Big bad caused a mighty fine sensation - yeah, yeah
Gone and got himself elected president
(We want Leroy for president)

Next time, you gotta hit a bitty baddy weather
This time, like a shimmy, shammy leather

He's a big boy, bad boy, Leroy
I don't care where you get him from
Dubby du dah, dubby du dah, dubby du dah
Bring that big bad Leroy back
Want him back&lt;/lyrics&gt;

I know
I'm jealous of her
She makes me need
She is my love
She is my love

Who knows who she'll make me
As I lie in her cocoon
And the world will surely heal my ills
I'm warm and terrified
She makes me so

I know the day I leave her
I'll love her still
She is my love
She is my love

Who knows where my dreams will end
I'll follow as they grow
But the world will know how long I'll take
And if I'm very slow she makes me so

She is my love
She is my love&lt;/lyrics&gt;

Hey hey hey
No I'll never look back in anger
No I'll never find me an answer
You promised me, you'd keep in touch
I read your letter and it hurt me so much
I said I'd never, never be angry with you

I don't wanna feel like a stranger (no)
'Cos I'd rather stay out of danger
I read your letter so many times
I got your meaning between the lines
I said I'd never, never be angry with you

I must be strong so she won't know how much I miss her
I only hope as time goes on I'll forget her
My body's aching, can't sleep at night
I'm too exhausted to start a fight
And if I see her with another guy
I'll eat my heart out 'cos I love, love, love, love her

Come on baby, let's get together
I'll love you baby, I'll love you forever
I'm trying hard to stay away
What made you change, what did I say?
Ooh I need your loving tonight
Ooh I need your loving
Ooh I need your loving
Ooh I need your loving babe tonight (Hit me)
Ooh I need your loving tonight

No I'll never look back in anger
No I'll never find me an answer
Gave me no warning, how could I guess
I'll have to learn to forgive and forget

Ooh I need your loving tonight&lt;/lyrics&gt;

Don't do it (no) don't do it (no) - don't

Don't try suicide
Nobody's worth it
Don't try suicide
Nobody cares
Don't try suicide
You're just gonna hate it
Don't try suicide
Nobody gives - nobody gives
Nobody gives a damn
OK&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;(To the sister I never had)

Hey little babe you're changing
Babe are you feeling sore?
It ain't no use in pretending
You don't wanna play no more

It's plain that you ain't no baby
What would your mother say
You're all dressed up like a lady
How come you behave this way, yeah

Sail away sweet sister
Sail across the sea
Maybe you find somebody
To love you half as much as me
My heart is always with you
No matter what you do
Sail away sweet sister
I'll always be in love with you

Forgive me for what I told you
My heart makes a fool of me
Ooh, you know I'll never hold you
I know that you gotta be free, yeah

Sail away sweet sister
Sail across the sea
Maybe you find somebody
To love you half as much as me
Take it the way you want it
But when they let you down my friend
Sail away sweet sister
Back to my arms again

Hot child don't you know you're young
You got your whole life ahead of you
And you can throw it away too soon
Way too soon, aah yeah

Sail away sweet sister
Sail across the sea
Maybe you find somebody
Gonna love you half as much as me - yeah
My heart is always with you
No matter what you do
Sail away sweet sister
I'll always be in love with you
Aaha&lt;/lyrics&gt;

They're always

&lt;lyrics&gt;We had a good night jamming away
There was a full moon showing
And we started to play
But in the cold light of day next morning
Party was over - huh
The party was over
We got love and we got style
And we got sex and I know I know we got what it takes
Woah woah woah woah woah
Woah woah woah
Why don't you come back and play
Come back and play - hey hey - come back and play
We got all night all day
Everybody's gone away
Why don't you come back and play - play play, come back and play
Come back and play, come back and play play play play, aah
Go get 'em boy - let's party
Yeah - ha ha ha ha haaa - give it, give it
We had a food fight in somebody's face
We were up all night singing - singin'
And giving a chase
But in the cold light of day next morning
Everybody was hung-over
Hey, come back and play, come back and play, come back and play
We got all night all day
Everybody's gone away
Why don't you come back and play - and play
Come back and play
We got all night, we got all day
We got all night to play
Ah, comeback, comeback, comeback, comeback, comeback and play
Hey hey hey
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, the party is over&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Who said that my party was all over, huh, huh
I'm in pretty good shape
The best years of my life are like a super nova
A huh, huh, perpetual craze, I said that
Everybody drank my wine - you get my drift
And then we took a holiday on Khashoggi's ship - well
We really had a good good time they was all so sexy
We was bad, we was blitzed
All in all it was a pretty good trip

This big bad sucker with a fist as big as your head
Wanted to get me, I said go away
I said kiss my ass honey
He pulled out a gun, wanted to arrest me
I said uh, uh, babe
Now listen no-one stops my party
No-one stops my party
No-one, no-one, no-one stops my party
Just like I said, ooh
We were phased, we was pissed
Just having a total eclipse
Bop bop, ba dap bap, ee bap bap bap be dap bap, be de dee, hey
That's good, oh, oo ooo ooooo
This one's on me so let us do it just right
This here one party don't get started 'till midnight
Hey, ahh, everybody
Party to the left
Party to the right
Everyone in the middle doing all up all right
All right, hey
???
Doing all right
Hey, hey hah, hey hey right
Left - right
No-one stops my... haaaa&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I can see it in your stars
Life is so exciting
Acting so bizarre
Your world is so inviting
Playing really cool
And looking so mysterious - honey
Your every day is full of sunshine
But into every life a little rain must fall
No problem
Uh, be cool now

Anyone who imagines
They can blind you with science
Bully you all over
With property and finance
But you have position
To call the shots and name the price - honey
You found success and recognition
But into every life a little rain must fall
Flow John

You lead a fairy tale existence
But into every life a little rain must fall
Be cool, ha, kiss kiss

Others seem to think
You are over dramatising
Problems at work
So it's hardly surprising
There's little you can do
To alter their opinions - honey
You want a clean reputation
But now you're facing complications
'Cos into every life a little rain must fall
Be cool, get serious, wooh, alright

Play it nice and cool
Play it nice and cool - yeah
Chase me
Ooh, one more time, ha ha, I like it
Leave 'em there&lt;/lyrics&gt;

Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh
Scandal - now you've left me all the world's gonna know
Hey scandal, they're gonna turn our lives into a freak show
They'll see the heart-ache, they'll see our love break
They'll hear me pleading, we'll say for God's sakes
Over and over and over again
Scandal - now you've left me there's no healing the wounds
Hey scandal, and all the world can make us out to be fools
Here come the bad news, open the floodgates (oooh oooh)
They'll leave us bleeding, we say you cheapskates
(Oooh oooh)
Over and over and over again
So let them know when they stare, it's just a private affair
They'll have us hung in the air and tell me what do they care
It's only a life to be twisted and broken
They'll see the heart-ache, they'll see our love break - yeah
They'll hear me pleading, I'll say for God's sakes
Over and over and over and over again - yeah

Scandal, scandal
Scandal, scandal

Yes you're breaking my heart again
Scandal - yes it'll all and all happen again
Today the headlines, tomorrow hard times
And no-one ever really knows the truth from the lies
And in the end the story deeper must hide (oooh)
Deeper and deeper and deeper inside
Scandal, scandal
Scandal, scandal&lt;/lyrics&gt;

She winds me up then lets me go
Turns me on and then tells me no
She's just a pussy cat

My baby loves me
My baby loves me (ooh)
My baby cuffs me (ooh)
One day she'll tells me that she cares
Another day she tells me she don't love me
She really really does me
Ooh, people do you believe this?, do you?

&lt;lyrics&gt;Oooh, oooh
Ah ah ah ah ah oh

What is there left for me to do in this life
Did I achieve what I had set in my sights
Am I a happy man, or is this sinking sand
Was it all worth it, was it all worth it
Yeah, now hear my story, let me tell you about it
We bought a drum kit, I blew my own trumpet
Played the circuit, thought we were perfect
Was it all worth it, ooh giving (hey yeah) all my heart and soul and
Staying up all night, was it all worth it (hey yeah)
Living breathing rock 'n' roll (ah), a Godforsaken life
Was it all worth it, was it all worth it (hey) all these years

Put down our money without counting the cost
It didn't matter if we won - if we lost
Yes we were vicious, yes we could kill
Yes we were hungry, yes we were brill - ha ha haa
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
We served a purpose, like a bloody circus
We were so dandy (yeah) we love you madly
Was it all worth it
Living breathing rock 'n' roll, this Godforsaken life
Was it all worth it yeah, was it all worth it
When the hurly burly's done

We went to bali, saw God and dali
So mystic, surrealistic
Was it all worth it yeah yeah, giving all my heart and soul
Staying up all night, was it all worth it
Ooh living breathing rock 'n' roll this never ending fight
Was it all worth it, was it all worth it
Yes it was a worthwhile experience
Ha ha ha ha haa
It was worth it
Ha ha&lt;/lyrics&gt;

Don't lose your mystique
Wait a little longer
Tomorrow brings another feast

Don't let go
Don't lose your reputation
Thank God you're still alive, ha
You're still in one piece

Hang on in there, don't lose your appetite
Hang on in there, forget the danger signs
Pray for that magical moment (just stay there) and it will appear
(Don't fight for lost emotions)
Wait for the sunrise
And everything will seem so clear
(Look straight ahead, look straight ahead)

Hang on in there (hang on in there)
Hang on in there (hang on in there)
Your wish will be granted
All your problems will disappear

Don't be a fool
You haven't reached your peak
You've got a fast car racing up inside you
Your life is incomplete

Hang on in there, hang on in there
Pray for that magical moment and it will appear
(Wait for the moment)
Wait for the sunrise - oh
Just wait and see and it will seem so clear
Ba dap bap ee bap bap ba ba bap bap de de de da

And let's go, let's go - OK now do the change now
Hang on

&lt;lyrics&gt;I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible invisible invisible man

I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
Incredible how you can
See right through me
I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
It's criminal how I can
See right through you

When you hear a sound
That you just can't place
Feel somethin' move
That you just can't trace
When something sits
On the end of your bed
Don't turn around
When you hear me tread

I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
Incredible how you can
See right through me
I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
It's criminal how I can
See right through you

And I'm in your room
And I'm in your bed
And I'm in your life
And I'm in your head
Like C. I. A
Or the F. B. I
You'll never get close
Never take me alive

I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
Incredible how you can
See right through me
I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
It's criminal how I can
See right through you

I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man

I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
Incredible how you can
See right through me
I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
It's criminal how I can
See right through you

Hah, hah, hah, hello
Hah, hah, hah, o. k
Hah, hah, hah, hello-hello-hello-hello
Never had a real good friend - not a boy or girl
No-one knows what I've been through - let my flag unfurl
So I make my mark from the edge of the world
From the edge of the world
From the edge of the world

I'm the invisible invisible invisible invisible man&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Oh yeah
I'm gonna take a little walk on the wild side
I'm gonna loosen up and get me some gas
I'm gonna get me some action
Go crazy, driving in the fast lane
My baby left me alone
She done me dirty and I'm feeling so lonely
So come home, come home
If you don't you're gonna break my heart

Man on the prowl
You better watch out
I'm on the loose and I'm looking for trouble
So look out (yeah yeah) - look out (yeah yeah)
I'm a man on the prowl

I don't wanna be a rock 'n' roll steady
I just wanna be low down trash
I wanna go to the movies
All I wanna do is sit on my ass - ooh
So honey come home (come home come home)
Don't leave me when I'm feeling so lonely
Come home (yeah yeah) - come home (yeah yeah)
If you don't you're gonna break my heart

Man on the prowl
You better watch out
I'm on the loose and I'm looking for trouble
So look out (yeah yeah) - look out (yeah yeah)
'Cause I'm a man on the prowl

Well I keep dreaming about my baby
But it ain't gonna get me nowhere
(Bap bap) hey
I gonna teach my baby dancin'
(Bap bap)
But I ain't no Fred Astaire

So baby look out - I'm a man on the prowl
Look out - man on the prowl - yeah
Yeah - baby, baby, baby look out, yeah - man on the prowl

Baby come home
I'm on the loose and I'm looking for trouble
Baby come home - oh yeah

So honey come home - come home
'Cause I'm a man on the prowl - yeah
Man on the prowl - yeah
Hey, stay with it
Loosen up
Wooh yep ha wooh ha
Yeah&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;- &quot;Machines machines machines machines&quot;
- &quot;Machines machines machines machines aaah&quot;

It's a machines world
Don't tell me I ain't got no soul
When the machines take over
It ain't no place for rock and roll - ha

They tell me I don't care
But deep inside I'm just a man
They freeze me they burn me
They squeeze me they stretch me
With smoke-blackened pistons of steel they compress me
But no-one, but no-one, but no-one can wrest me away
Back to humans

- &quot;We have no disease, no troubles of mind&quot;
- &quot;No thank you or please, no regard for the time&quot;
- &quot;We never cry, we never retreat&quot;
- &quot;We have no conception of love or defeat&quot;

What's that machine noise
It's bytes and megachips for tea
It's that machine, boys
With random access memory
Never worry, never mind
Not for money, not for gold

Yeah
It's software, it's hardware
It's heartbeat is time-share
It's midwife's a disk drive
It's sex-life is quantised
It's self-perpetuating a parahumanoidarianised

Back to humans
Back to humans

- &quot;Back to machines machines machines&quot;

Woooh

- &quot;Machines machines&quot;

Living in a new world
Thinking in the past - humans
Living in a new world
How you gonna last - humans
Machine world... it's a machine's world...
Humans
Living in a new world
Thinking in the past - back to humans
Living in a new world
How you gonna last?
Machine world... it's a machine's world...
Machine world yeah yeah

- &quot;Change&quot;

It's a machine world wooh
Yeah I'm coming yeah yeah wooh
Back to humans - hey yeah
Ha ha haa
Back to humans

Back to humans
Living in a new world
How you gonna last?
Machine world
It's a machine's world&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;This is the only life for me - yeah
Surround myself around my own fantasy
You just gotta be strong and believe in yourself
Forget all the sadness 'cause love is all you need
Love is all you need

Do you know what it's like to be alone in this world
When you're down and out on your luck and you're a failure
Wake up screaming in the middle of the night
You think it's all been a waste of time
It's been a bad year
You start believing everything's gonna be alright
Next minute you're down and you're flat on your back
A brand new day is beginning
Get that sunny feeling and you're on your way (way)

Just believe - just keep passing the open windows
Just believe - just keep passing the open windows

Do you know how it feels when you don't have friend (friend)
Without a job and no money to spend
You're a stranger

All you think about is suicide
One of these days you're gonna lose the fight
You better keep out of danger - yeah
That same old feeling just keeps burning deep inside (inside)
You keep telling yourself it's gonna be the end
Oh - get yourself together
Things are looking better everyday (day)

Just believe - just keep passing the open windows
Just believe - just keep passing the open windows

This is the only life for me - yeah
Surround myself around my own fantasy

You just gotta be strong and believe in yourselves
Forget all the sadness 'cause love is all you need

Just believe - just keep passing the open windows
Just believe - just keep passing the open windows

You just gotta be strong and believe in yourselves
Forget all the sadness 'cause love is all you need yeah
Love is all you need
Oh baby love is all you need

Just believe - just keep passing the open windows
Just believe - just keep passing the open windows

Just keep passing the open windows
Just keep passing the open windows
Just keep passing the open windows
Just keep passing the open windows
Just keep passing the open windows
Just keep passing the open windows
Keep passing the open windows&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Covered in sinners and dripping with guilt
Making your money from slime and from filth
Parading your bellies in ivory towers
Investing our lives in your schemes and your powers

You've got to watch them - Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in heaven - The thief's in your head
You've got to watch them - Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in heaven - The thief in your head....

Be quick !
Or be dead !
Be quick !
Or be dead

See... what's ruling all our lives
See... who pulling strings...

See... what's ruling all our lives
See... who pulls the strings...

I bet you won't fall on your face
Your belly will hold you in place

The serpent is crawling inside of your ear
He says must vote for what you want to hear
Don't matter what's wrong as long as you're alright
So pull yourself stupid and rob yourself blind.

You got to watch them - Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in heaven - The thief in your head
You've got to watch them - Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in heaven - The thief's in your head....

Be quick!
Or be dead!
Be quick!
Or be dead!&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;She fell in love with his greasy machine
She leaned over wiped his kickstart clean
She'd never seen the beast before
But she left there wanting more more more

But when she was walking on down the road
She heard a sound that made her heart explode
He whispered to her to get on the back
&quot;I'll take you on ride from here to eternity&quot;

[Chorus: (2 times)]
Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity

She must be having one of her crazy dreams
She'd never sat on a piece so mean
It vvmade her feel like's she's on cloud nine
She even thought she heard the engine sign

But like all dreams that come to an end
They took a tumble at the devil's bend
The beast and Charlotte they were two of a kind
They'd always take the line... from here to eternity&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Give me the sense to wonder
To wonder if I'm free
Give me a sense of wonder
To know I can be me
Give me the strength to hold my head up
Spit back in their face
Don't need no key to unlock this door
Gonna break down the walls
Break out of this bad place

[Chorus]
Can I play with madness - the prophet stared at his crystal ball
Can I play with madness - there's no vision there at all
Can I play with madness - the prophet looked and he laughed at me
Can I play with madness - he said you're blind, too blind to see

I screamed aloud to the old man
I said don't lie, don't say you don't know
I say you'll pay for your mischief
In this world or the next
Oh, and then he fixed me with a freezing glance
And the hell fires raged in his eyes
He said, you want to know the truth son
- I'll tell you the truth
Your soul's gonna burn in the lake of fire

[Chorus x2]
Can I play with madness - the prophet stared at his crystal ball
Can I play with madness - there's no vision there at all
Can I play with madness - the prophet looked and he laughed at me
Can I play with madness - he said you're blind, too blind to see&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Maybe one day I'll be an honest man
Up till now I'm doing the best I can
Long roads.Long days, of sunrise, to sunset
Sunrise to sunset

Dream on brothers while you can
Dream on sisters I hope you will find the one
All of our lives, covered up quickly by the tides of time

Spend your days full of emptiness
Spend your years full of loneliness
Wasting love, in a desperate caress
Rolling shadows of night

Dream on brothers while you can
Dream on sisters I hope you will find the one
All of our lives, covered up quickly by the tides of time

Sands are flowing and the lines are in your hand
In your eyes I see the hunger, and the desperate cry that tears the night

Spend your days full of emptiness
Spend your years full of loneliness
Wasting love, in a desperate caress
Rolling shadows of night&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Trace your way back 50 years
To the Glow of Dresden - blood and tears
In the black above by the cruel searchlight
Men will die and men will fight - yeah!
Who shot who and who fired first?
Dripping death to whet the bloodthirst
No radar lock on - skin and bone
The bomber boys are going home

[Chorus]
Climb into the sky never wonder why - Tailgunner
You're a Tailgunner
[repeat]

Nail that Fokker kill that son,
Gonna blow your guts out with my gun,
The weather forecasts good for War
Cologne and Frankfurt? have some more!
Tail end Charlie in the boiling sky
The Enola Gay was my last try
Now that this Tailgunner's gone
No more Bombers (just one big bomb)&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Love is a razor, and I walked the line
On that silver blade
Slept in the dust with his daughter
Her eyes red with
The slaughter of innocence
But I will pray for her
I will call her name out loud
I would bleed for her
If only I could see her now

Living on a razors edge
Balancing on a ledge
Living on a rasors edge

The evil that men do lives on and on....
The evil that men do lives on and on....
The evil that men do lives on and on....
The evil that men do lives on and on....

Circle of fire, my baptism of joy at an end it seems
The seventh lamb slain
The book of life opens before me
But I will pray for you
And some day I may return
I would die for you
Beyond is where I learn&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Lying awake at night I wipe the sweat from my brow
But it's not fear 'cos I'd rather go now
Trying to visualise the horrors that will lay ahead
The desert sand mound a burial ground

When it comes to the time
Are we partners in crime ?
When it comes to the time
We'll be ready to die

God let us go now and finish what's to be done
Thy Kingdom come
Thy shall be done... on earth

Trying to justify to ourselves the reasons to go
Should live and let live
Forget or forgive

But how can we let them go on this way ?
The reign of terror corruption must end
And we know deep down there's no other way
No trust, no reasoning, no more to say

Afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid to shoot strangers.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Can't understand what is happening to me
This isn't real this is only a dream
But I never have felt, no I never have felt this
way before
I'm looking down on my body below
I lie asleep in the midst of a dream
Is it now could it be the Angel of Death has come for me
I can't believe that really my time has come
I don't feel ready there's so much left undone
And it's my soul and I'm not gonna let it get away

[Chorus:]
Heaven can wait / Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait / Heaven can wait til another day

I have a lust for the Earth below
And Hell itself is my only foe
'Cause I've no fear of dying
I'll go when I'm good and ready
I snatch a glimpse of the lights eternal rays
I see a tunnel I stand amazed
At all of the people standing there in front of me
Into the paths of rightness I'll be led
Is this the place where the living join the dead
I wish I knew this was only just a nightmare

[Chorus:]

Take my hand I'll lead you to the promised land
Take my hand I'll give you immortality
Eternal youth I'll take you to the other side
To see the truth the path for you is decided

My body tingles I feel so strange
I feel so tired I feel so drained
And I'm wondering if I'll ever be the same again
Is this in limbo or Heaven or Hell
Maybe I'm going down there as well
I can't accept my soul will drift forever
I feel myself floating back down to Earth
So could this be the hour of my rebirth
Or have I died or will I wake from dreaming?&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Feel the sweat break on my brow
Is it me, or is it shadows that are
Dancing on the walls
Is this dream, or is it now
Is this a vision, or normality I see
Before my eyes

I wonder why, I wonder how
That it seems the power's getting stronger
Every day
I feel a strength, an inner fire
But I'm scared I won't be able to control it anymore

There's a time to live, and time to die
When it's time to meet the maker
There's a time to live, but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born, you're dying.

There's a time to live, and time to die
When it's time to meet the maker
There's a time to live, but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born, you're dying.

Just by looking through your eyes
He could see the future penetrating right
In through your mind
See the truth and see your lies
But for all his power, couldn't foresee his own demise

There's a time to live, and time to die
When it's time to meet the maker
There's a time to live, but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born, you're dying.

There's a time to live, and time to die
When it's time to meet the maker
There's a time to live, but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born you're dying....
....and be reborn again??&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I am a man who walks alone
And when I'm walking a dark road
At night or strolling through the park

When the light begins to change
I sometimes feel a little strange
A little anxious when it's dark.

Fear of the dark,fear of the dark
I have constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark,fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

Have you run your fingers down the wall
And have you felt your neck skin crawl
When you're searching for the light ?
Sometimes when you're scared to take a look
At the corner of the room
You've sensed that something's watching you.

Have you ever been alone at night
Thought you heard footsteps behind
And turned around and no-one's there ?
And as you quicken up your pace
You find it hard to look again
Because you're sure there's someone there

Watching horror films the night before
Debating witches and folklore
The unknown troubles on your mind
Maybe your mind is playing tricks
You sense,and suddenly eyes fix
On dancing shadows from behind.

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there.

When I'm walking a dark road
I am a man who walks alone&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I left alone my mind was blank
I needed time to think to get the memories from my mind
What did I see could I believe
That what I saw that night was real and not just fantasy

Just what I saw in my old dreams
Were they reflections of my warped mind staring back at me
'Cause in my dream it's always there
The evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair


Night was black was no use holding back
'Cause I just had to see was someone watching me
In the mist dark figures move and twist
Was this all for real or some kind of hell

Six, six six: the number of the beast
Hell and fire was spawned to be released

Torches blazed and sacred chants were praised
As they start to cry hands held to the sky
In the night the fires were burning bright
The ritual has begun, Satan's work is done

Six, six six: the number of the beast
Sacrifice is going on tonight


This can't go on I must inform the law
Can this still be real or just some crazy dream
But I feel drawn towards the chanting hordes
They seem to mesmerise... can't avoid their eyes

Six, six six: the number of the beast
Six, six six: the one for you and me

I'm coming back, I will return
And I'll possess your body and I'll make you burn
I have the fire, I have the force
I have the power to make my evil take it's course&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;You'll take my life but I'll take yours too
You'll fire your musket but I'll run you through
So when you're waiting for the next attack
You'd better stand there's no turning back

The Bugle sounds and the charge begins
But on this battlefield no one wins
The smell of acrid smoke and horses breath
As I plunge on into certain death

The horse he sweats with fear we break to run
The mighty roar of the Russian guns
And as we race towards the human wall
The screams of pain as my comrades fall

We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
And the Russians fire another round
We get so near yet so far away
We won't live to fight another day


We get so close near enough to fight
When a Russian gets me in his sights
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow
A burst of rounds take my horse below

And as I lay there gazing at the sky
My body's numb and my throat is dry
And as I lay forgotten and alone
Without a tear I draw my parting groan&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Walking through the city looking oh so pretty,
I've just got to find my way.
See the ladies flashing all their legs and lashes,
I've just got to find my way.

Well, you see me crawling through the bushes
With it open wide. (What you seeing girl?)
Can't you believe that feeling, can't you believe it,
Can't you believe your eyes? (It's the real thing girl!)

Got me feeling myself and reeling around,
Got me talking but feel like walking around.

Got me feeling myself and reeling --
Got me talking but nothing's with me --
Got me feeling myself and reeling around.

Walking through the city looking oh so pretty,
I've just got to find my way.
See the ladies flashing all their legs and lashes,
I've just got to find my way.

Well, you see me crawling through the bushes
With it open wide. (What you seeing girl?)
Can't you believe that feeling, can't you believe it,
Can't you believe your eyes? (It's the real thing girl!)

Got me feeling myself and reeling around,
Got me talking but feel like walking around.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Unchain the colours before my eyes,
Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies.
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher,
I shall return from out of fire.

Tears for rememberance, and tears for joy,
Tears for somebody and this lonely boy.
Out in the madness, the all seeing eye,
Flickers above us, to light up the sky.

Unchain the colours before my eyes,
Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies.
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher,
I shall return from out of fire.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;It's snowing outside the rumbling sound
of engines roar in the night,
The mission is near the confident men
are waiting to drop from the sky.

The Blizzard goes on but still they must fly
No one should go where eagles dare.

Bavarian alps that lay all around
they seem to stare from below,
The enemy lines a long time passed
are lying deep in the snow.

Into the night they fall through the sky
No one should fly where eagles dare.

They're closing in the fortress is near
it's standing high in the sky,
The cable car's the only way in
it's really impossible to climb.

They make their way but maybe too late
They've got to try to save the day.

The panicking cries the roaring of guns
are echoing all round the valley,
The mission complete they make to escape
away from the Eagles Nest.

They dared to go where no one would try
they chose to fly where eagles dare.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Out of winter came a warhorse of steel
I've never killed a woman before
But I know how it feels
I know you'd have gone insane
If you saw what I saw
So now I've got to look for
Sanctuary from the law

I met up with a stranger last night
To keep me alive
He spends all his time on gambling
And guns to survive
I know you'd have gone insane if you saw what I saw
So now I've got to look for Sanctuary from the law

[CHORUS]
So give me Sanctuary from the law
And I'll be alright
Just give me Sanctuary from the law
And love me tonight...tonight

I know you'd have gone insane if you saw what I saw
So now I've got to look for Sanctuary from the law

[CHORUS]

I can laugh at the wind
I can howl at the rain
Down in the canyon or out on the plains

I know you'd have gone insane if you saw what I saw
So now I've got to look for Sanctuary from the law&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Just sixteen, a pickup truck
Out of money, out of luck
I've got nowhere to call my own
Hit the gas, and here I go

I'm running free yeah
I'm running free
I'm running free yeah
I'm running free

Spent the night in an L. A. jail
And listened to the sirens wail
They ain't got a thing on me
I'm running wild, I'm running free

I'm running free yeah
I'm running free
I'm running free yeah
I'm running free

Give out money



I'm running free yeah
I'm running free
I'm running free yeah
I'm running free

Right?

Puller here at the Bottle Top
Whiskey, dancing, disco hop
Now all the boys are after me
And that's the way it's gonna be

I'm running free yeah
I'm running free
I'm running free yeah
I'm running free

Oh, I'm running free yeah
I'm running free
I'm running free yeah (I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, oh yeah yeah I'm running)
I'm running free&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Kill for gain or shoot to maim
But we don't need a reason
The Golden Goose is on the loose
And never out of season
Some blackened pride still burns inside
This shell of bloody treason
Here's my gun for a barrel of fun
For the love of living death

The killer's breed or the Demon's seed,
The glamour, the fortune, the pain,
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
But don't you pray for my soul anymore.

2 minutes to midnight,
The hands that treaten doom.
2 minutes to midnight,
To kill the unborn in the womb.

The blind men shout &quot;Let the creatures out
We'll show the unbeliverers.&quot;
The napalm screams of human flames
Of a prime time Belsen feast ... yeah!
As the reasons for the carnage cut their meat and lick the gravy
We oil the jaws of the war machine and feed it with our babies.

The killer's breed or the Demon's seed,
The glamour, the fortune, the pain,
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
But don't you pray for my soul anymore.

2 minutes to midnight,
The hands that treaten doom.
2 minutes to midnight,
To kill the unborn in the womb.

The body bags and little rags of children torn in two
And the jellied brains of those who remain to put the finger right on you
As the madmen play on words and make us all dance to their song
To the tune of starving millions to make a better kind of gun.

The killer's breed or the Demon's seed,
The glamour, the fortune, the pain,
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
But don't you pray for my soul anymore.

2 minutes to midnight,
The hands that treaten doom.
2 minutes to midnight,
To kill the unborn in the womb.

Midnight
Midnight
Midnight
It's all night

Midnight
Midnight
Midnight
It's all night&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Won't you come into my room, I wanna show you all my wares.
I just want to see your blood, I just want to stand and stare.
See the blood begin to flow as it falls upon the floor.
Iron Maiden can't be fought, Iron Maiden can't be sought.

Oh well, whatever, wherever you are,
Iron Maiden's gonna get you, no matter how far.
See the blood flow watching it shed up above my head.
Iron Maiden wants you for dead.

Won't you come into my room, I wanna show you all my wares.
I just want to see your blood, I just want to stand and stare.
See the blood begin to flow as it falls upon the floor.
Iron Maiden can't be fought, Iron Maiden can't be sought.

Oh well, whatever, wherever you are,
Iron Maiden's gonna get you, no matter how far.
See the blood flow watching it shed up above my head.
Iron Maiden wants you for dead.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I'm waiting in my cold cell when the bell begins to chime.
Reflecting on my past life, and it doesn't have much time.
Cause at 5 o'clock, they take me to the gallows pole.
The sands of time for me are running low.

When the priest comes to read me the last rites,
I take a look through the bars at the last sights
Of a world that has gone very wrong for me.
Can it be that there's some sort of error?
Hard to stop the surmounting terror!
Is it really the end, not some crazy dream?!

Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming.
It's not easy to stop from screaming,
But words escape me, when I try to speak.
Tears fall, but why am I crying?
After all, I am not afraid of dying;
Don't I believe that there is never an end?

As the guards march me out to the courtyard
Somebody cries from a cell, &quot;God be with you!&quot;
If there's a God then why does he let me go?
As I walk all my life drifts before me;
Though the end is near I'm not sorry.
Catch my soul, it's willing to fly away.

Mark my words, believe my soul lives on.
Don't worry now that I have gone;
I've gone beyond to see the truth.
When you know that your time is close at hand,
Maybe then you'll begin to understand that
Life down here is just a strange illusion.

Yeah
Hallowed be thy name
Yeah&lt;/lyrics&gt;

Hey, I noticed you were the first to fill in the [[Dave Matthews Band:Captain]] page, and you had some mixed punctuation, as far as the apostrophes on some of the contractions.  Did you take the lyrics from another site or something per chance?  It's not that big of a deal, but I noticed in some areas you used &lt;font size=5&gt;’&lt;/font&gt; and others you used &lt;font size=5&gt;'&lt;/font&gt;.  This was brought up at the [[Help:Standards]] Talk page as well, under [http://www.lyriki.com/index.php?title=Help_talk:Standards#Apostrophe.27s Apostrophe's]. --[[User:Ahoier|ahoier]] 05:40, 11 October 2006 (PDT)</text>

&lt;lyrics&gt;Crazy as I may 
Make my way through this world
It's for no one but me to say 
What direction I shall turn in now

I am the captain of this ship
Curious hands and fingertips
Day after day 
How I long for you my love
How I long

Strange but it seems
Like there's a mutiny brewing inside me now
But I don't want your pity
Only the promise that you'll stay with me tonight

I am the captain of this ship
Curious hands and fingertips
But day after day
Oh how I long for you like crazy

Oh our love, how you do me
Oh my love, come on let's go again
Oh our love, everything
Oh won't you play with me again?
Got all night

Same old song 
Won't you come and stay?
Oh my love
After all
Oh how could I even try to fight after falling into your arms?
Oh mesmerized by your smile the way it lights up under your eyes
Oh how could I even try?
Love won't you stay with me?

Oh our love, how you do me
Oh my love, come on let's go again
Oh our love, everything
Oh won't you play with me again?
We got all night

The same old song
Won't you come dance with me my love?
After all&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;
We’ve never been much chop at all that sensual stuff
One of us always seems to stop before the other’s had enough
Like a self-help manual that’s been written in Braille
It seems the more that we touch, the more we learn about our failings

I’m struck speechless by the nape of your neck
But your requests and suggestions have a similar effect
A litany of prettiness and pettiness too
I reckon every second second we come up with something new

I tried to write an opera for us
But I didn’t get that far
’Cause trying to sum you up in song
Is like catching sunlight in a jar

Complex, completely credible love
The kind that is made not handed to you from above
Is difficult to talk about and harder to write
Like the rhythm of a pulse, or the contours of firelight

Overblown libretto and a sumptuous score
Could never contain the contradictions I adore
We can just be chaos and then something aligns
It’s hard to attain, maintain and or define it

I tried to write another chorus
But I didn’t get that far
’Cause trying to sum you up in song
Is like catching sunlight in a jar
It’s like catching sunlight in a jar
Sunlight in a jar
Like catching sunlight in a jar

&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Karma Police, arrest this man
He talks in math
He buzzes like a fridge
He's like a de-tuned radio

Karma Police, arrest this girl
Her Hitler hairdo
Is making me feel ill
And we have crashed her party

This is what you get
This is what you get
This is what you get
When you mess with us

Karma Police, I've given all I can
It's not enough
I've given all I can
But we're still on the payroll

This is what you get
This is what you get
This is what you get
When you mess with us

For a minute there
I lost myself
I lost myself
Phew, for a minute there
I lost myself
I lost myself

For a minute there
I lost myself
I lost myself
Phew, for a minute there
I lost myself
I lost myself&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;A heart that's full up like a landfill
A job that slowly kills you
Bruises that won't heal

You look so tired, unhappy
Bring down the government
They don't, they don't speak for us

I'll take a quiet life
A handshake of carbon monoxide with

No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises

Silent
Silent

This is my final fit
My final belly-ache with

No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises, please

Such a pretty house
And such a pretty garden

No alarms and no surprises 
No alarms and no surprises 
No alarms and no surprises, please&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Wake from your sleep
The drying of your tears
Today we escape, we escape

Pack and get dressed
Before your father hears us
Before all hell breaks loose

Breathe, keep breathing
Don't lose your nerve
Breathe, keep breathing
I can't do this alone

Sing us a song
A song to keep us warm
There's such a chill
Such a chill

You can laugh, a spineless laugh
We hope your rules and wisdom choke you

And now we are one
In everlasting peace

We hope that you choke, that you choke
We hope that you choke, that you choke
We hope that you choke, that you choke&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;There's an evil virus that's threatening mankind
Not state of the art, a serious state of the mind
The muggers, the backstabbers, the two face elite
A menace to society, a social disease.

Rape of the mind is a social disorder 
The cynics, the apathy oneupmanship order

Watching beginnings of social decay
Gloating or seering at life's disarray
Eating away at your own self esteem
Pouncing on every word that you might be saying

Rape of the mind is a social disorder 
The cynics, the apathy oneupmanship order

Superficially smiling a shake of the hand
As soon as the back is turned treachery is planned

Rape of the mind is a social disorder 
The cynics, the apathy oneupmanship order

Watching beginnings of social decay
Gloating or seering...at life'ss disarray

When every good thing?s laid to waste
By all the jealousy and hate
By all the acid wit and rapier lies

And every time you think you're safe
And when you go to turn away
You know they're sharpening all their papers knives

All in your mind
All in your head
Try to relate it

All in your mind
All in your head
Try to escape it

Without a conscience they destroy
And that's a thing that they enjoy
They're a sickness that's in all our minds

They want to sink the ship and leave
The way they laugh at you and me
You know it happens all the time

All in your mind
All in your head
Try to relate it

All in your mind
All in your head
Try to escape it

The rats in the cellar you know who you are..
Or do you?
Try to relate it

Watching beginnings of social decay...&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Eleven saintly shrouded men
Silhouettes stand against the sky
One in front with a cross held high
Come to wash my sins away

Standing alone in the wind and rain
Feeling the fear that is growing
Sensing the change in the tide again
Caught by the storm that is brewing
Feel the anxiety hold off the fear
Some of the doubt in the things you believe
Now that your faith will be put to the test
Nothing to do but await that is coming

Why then is god still protecting me
Even when I don't deserve it
Thought I am blessed with an inner strength
Some they would call it a penance
Why am I meant to face this alone
Asking the question time and again
Praying to god won't keep me alive
Inside my head feel the fear start to rise...

They'll be saying their prayers when the moment comes
There'll be penace to pay when it's judgement day
And the guilty'll be bleeding when that moment comes
They'll be coming to claim, take your soul away

The sign of the cross
The name of the rose, a fire in the sky
The sign of the cross

They'll be coming to bring the eternal flame
They'll be bringing us all immortality
Holding communion so the world be blessed
My creator, my god'll lay my soul to rest

The sign of the cross
The name of the rose, a fire in the sky
The sign of the cross

Lost the love of father above
Chose the lust of the earth below
Eleven saintly shrouded men
Come to wash my sins away&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Lying awake at night I wipe the sweat
from my brow
But it's not the fear 'cos
I'd rather go now

Trying to visualize the horrors that
will lay ahead
The desert sand mound a burial ground

When it comes to the time
Are we partners in crime?
When it comes to the time
Will be ready to die

God let us go now and finish what's
to be done
Thy Kingdom Come
Thy shall be done... on earth

Trying to justify to ourselves the
reasons to go
Should we live and let live
Forget or forgive

But how can we let them go on this way?
The reign of terror corruption must end
And we know deep down there's
no other way
No trust, no reasoning, no more to say

Afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid to shoot strangers&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;The freeway is jammed
and it's backed up for miles
The car is an oven and baking is wild
Nothing is ever the way it should be
What we deserve we just don't get you see

A briefcase a lunch and a man on the edge
Each step gets closer to losing his head
Is someone in heaven are they looking down
Cause nothing is fair just you look around

Falling down
Falling down
Falling down

He's sick of waiting of lying like this
There's a hole in the sky for the angels to kiss
Branded a leper because you don't fit
In the land of the free
you can live by your wits

Once he built missiles a nation's defence
Now he can't even give birthday presents
Accross the city he leaves in his wake
A glimpse of the future a cannibal state

Falling down
Falling down
Falling down&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I am a man who walks alone
And when I'm walking a dark road
At night or strolling through the park

When the light begins to change
I sometimes feel a little strange
A little anxious when it's dark

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear that something's
always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's
always there

Have you run your fingers down
the wall
And have you felt your neck skin crawl
When you're searching for the light?
Sometimes when you're scared
to take a look
At the corner of the room
You've sensed that something's
watching you

Have you ever been alone at night
Thought you heard footsteps behind
And turned around and no one's there?
And as you quicken up your pace
You find it hard to look again
Because you're sure there's
someone there
Watching horror films the night before
Debating witches and folklores
The unknown troubles on your mind
Maybe your mind is playing tricks
You sense, and suddenly eyes fix
On dancing shadows from behind

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear that something's
always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's
always there

When I'm walking a dark road
I am a man who walks alone&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Believe in me send no money
I died on the cross and that ain't funny
But my so called friends they're making me a joke
They missed out what I said like I never spoke
They choose what they wanna hear they don't tell a lie
They just leave out the truth as they're watching you die
They're saving your souls by taking your money
Flies around shit bees around honey

Holy Smoke, Holy Smoke
There's plenty bad preachers for the Devil to stoke
Feed 'em in feet first this is no joke
This is thirsty work making Holy Smoke yeah
Making Holy Smoke

Jimmy Reptile and all his friends
Say they gonna be with you at the end
Burning records burning books
Holy soldiers Nazi looks
Crocodile smiles just wait a while
Till the TV Queen gets her make - up clean
I've lived in filth I've lived in sin
And I still smell cleaner than the shit you're in

[Chorus:]
They ain't religious but they ain't no fools
When Noah built his Cadillac it was cool
Two by two they're still going down
And the satellite circus just left town
I think they're strange and when they're dead
They can have a Lincoln for their bed
Friend of the President trick of the tail
Now they ain't got a prayer 100 years in jail&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Here they stand, brothers them all
All the sons, divided they'd fall
Here await the birth of the son
The seventh, the heavenly, the chosen one

Here the birth from an unbroken line
Born the healer, the seventh, his time
Unknowingly blessed and as his life unfolds
Slowly unveiling the power he holds

Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son

Then they watch the progress he makes
The Good and the Evil which path will he take
Both of them trying to manipulate
The use of his powers, before it's too late

Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son

Today is born the seventh one
Born of woman the seventh son
And he in turn of a seventh son
He has the power to heal
He has the gift of the second sight
He is the chosen one
So it shall be written
So it shall be done&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;From the coast of gold, across the seven seas,
I'm travelling on, far and wide,
But now it seems, I'm just a stranger to myself,
And all the things I sometimes do, it isn't me but someone else.

I close my eyes, and think of home,
Another city goes by, in the night,
Ain't it funny how it is, you never miss it til it's gone away,
And my heart is lying there and will be til my dying day.

So understand Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years,
Face up...make your stand,
And realise you're living in the golden years.

Too much time on my hands, I got you on my mind,
Can't ease this pain, so easily,
When you can't find the words to say, it's hard to make it through another day,
And it makes me wanna cry, and throw my hands up to the sky.

So understand
Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years,
Face up...make your stand,
And realise you're living in the golden years&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Hear the rime of the ancient mariner
See his eye as he stops one of three
Mesmerises one of the wedding guests
Stay here and listen to the nightmares of the sea.

And the music plays on, as the bride passes by
Caught by his spell and the mariner tells his tale.

Driven south to the land of the snow and ice
To a place where nobody's been
Through the snow fog flies on the albatross
Hailed in God's name, hoping good luck it brings.

And the ship sails on, back to the North
Through the fog and ice and the albatross follows on.

The mariner kills the bird of good omen
His shipmates cry against what he's done
But when the fog clears, they justify him
And make themselves a part of the crime.

Sailing on and on and north across the sea
Sailing on and on and north 'til all is calm.

The albatross begins with its vengeance
A terrible curse a thirst has begun
His shipmates blame bad luck on the mariner
About his neck, the dead bird is hung.

And the curse goes on and on at sea
And the curse goes on and on for them and me.

&quot;Day after day, day after day,
we stuck nor breath nor motion
as idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean
Water, water everywhere and
all the boards did shrin
Water, water everywhere nor any drop to drink.&quot;

There calls the mariner
There comes a ship over the line
But how can she sail with no wind in her sails and no tide.
See...onward she comes
Onward she nears out of the sun
See, she has no crew
She has no life, wait but here's two.

Death and she Life in Death,
They throw their dice for the crew
She wins the mariner and he belongs to her now.
Then...crew one by one
they drop down dead, two hundred men
She...she, Life in Death.
She lets him live, her chosen one.

&quot;One after one by the star dogged moon,
too quick for groan or sigh
each turned his facce with a ghastly pang
and cursed me with his eye
four times fifty living men
(and I heard nor sigh nor groan)
with heavy thump, a lifeless lump,
they dropped down one by one.&quot;

The curse it lives on in their eyes
The mariner wished he'd die
Along with the sea creatures
But they lived on, so did he.

and by the light of the moon
He prays for their beauty not doom
With heart he blesses them
God's creatures all of them too.

Then the spell starts to break
The albatross falls from his neck
Sinks down like lead into the sea
Then down in falls comes the rain.

Hear the groans of the long dead seamen
See them stir and they start to rise
Bodies lifted by good spirits
None of them speak and they're lifelesss in their eyes

And revenge is still sought, penance starts again
Cast into a trance and the nightmare carries on.

Now the curse is finally lifted
And the mariner sights his home
spirits go fromhe long dead bodies
Form their own light and the mariner's left alone.

And then a boat came sailing towards him
It was a joy he could not believe
The pilot's boat, his son and the hermit,
Penance of life will fall onto him.

And the ship sinks like lead into the sea
And the hermit shrieves the mariner of his sins.

The mariner's bound to tell of his story
To tell this tale wherever he goes
To teach God's word by his own example
That we must love all things thaat God made.

And the wedding guest's a sad and wiser man
And the tale goes on and on and on.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;There goes the siren that warns of the air raid
Then comes the sound of the guns sending flak
Out for the scramble we've got to get airborne
Got to get up for the coming attack.

Jump in the cockpit and start up the engine
Remove all the wheelblocks there's no time to waste
Gathering speed as we head down the runway
Gotta get airborne before it's too late.

Running, scrambling, flying
Rolling, turning, diving, going in again
Run, live to fly, fly to live, do or die
Run, live to fly, fly to live. Aces high.

Move in to fire at the main stream of bombers
Let off a sharp burst and then turn away
Roll over, spin round to come in behind them
Move to their blindsides and firing again.

Bandits at 8 O'clock move in behind us
Ten ME-109s out of the sun
Ascending and turning our Spitfires to face them
Heading straight for them I press down my guns

Rolling, turning, diving
Rolling, turning, diving, going in again
Run, live to fly, fly to live, do or die
Run, live to fly, fly to live, Aces high.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;&quot;O God of Earth and Altar,
Bow down and hear our cry,
Our earthly rulers falter,
Our people drift and die,
The walls of gold entomb us,
The swords of scorn divide,
Take not thy thunder from us,
But take away our pride.&quot;
(G. K. Chesterton; English Hymnal)

Just a babe in the black abyss,
No reason for a place like this,
The walls are cold and souls cry out in pain,
An easy way for the blind to go,
A clever path for the fools who know
the Secret of the Hanged Man-the smile on his lips.
The light of the Blind-you'll see,
The venom that tears my spine,
The Eyes of the Nile are opening-you'll see.

She came to me with a serpent's kiss,
As the Eye of the Sun Rose on her lips,
Moonlight catches silver tears I cry,
So we lay in the black embrace,
And the Seed is sown in a holy place
And I watched, and I waited for the dawn.

The light of the Blind-you'll see,
The venom that tears my spine,
The Eyes of the Nile are opening-you'll see.

Bind all of us together,
Ablaze with Hope and Free,
No storm or heavy weather
Will rock the boat you'll see.
The time has come to close your eyes
And still the wind and rain,
For the one who will be King
Is the Watcher in the Ring,
It is You.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

On the run, I'll kill to eat
I'm starving now you're dead on my feet
Going all the way nature's beast
Do what I want as I please

Run, fight, to breathe, it's tough
Now you see me, haha, now you don't
Break the walls, I'm coming out

Not a prisoner, I'm a free man
And my blood is my own now
Don't care where the past was
I know where I'm going ... out

If you kill me, it's self defense
If I kill you, then I call it vengeance
Spit in your eye, I will defy
You'll be afraid when I call out your name

Run, fight, to breathe, it's gonna be tough
Now you see me, now you don't
Break the walls, I'm coming out

Not a prisoner, I'm a free man
And my blood is my own now
Don't care where the past was
I know where I'm going

I'm not a number, I'm a free man
Live my life where I want to 
You'd better scratch me from your black book
'Cause I'll run rings round you

*guitar solo*

Not a prisoner, I'm a free man
And my blood is my own now
Don't care where the past was
I know where I'm going

Not a number, not a free man
Live my life where I want to
You'd better scratch me from you black book
'Cause I'll run rings around you

Not a prisoner, not a free man
And my blood is my own now
Don't care where the past was
I know where I'm going&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;White man came across the sea
He brought us pain and misery
He killed our tribes, he killed our creed
He took our game for his own need

We fought him hard, we fought him well
Out on the plains we gave him hell
But many came too much for Cree
Oh will we ever be set free?

Riding through dustclouds and barren wastes
Galloping hard on the plains
Chasing the redskins back to their holes
Fighting them at their own game
Murder for freedom a stab in the back
Women and children are cowards attack

Run to the hills, run for your lives
Run to the hills, run for your lives

Soldier blue on the barren wastes
Hunting and killing's their game
Raping the women and wasting the men
The only good Indians are tame
Selling them whiskey and taking their gold
Enslaving the young and destroying the old

Run to the hills, run for your lives
Run to the hills, run for your lives

Run to the hills, run for your lives
Run to the hills, run for your lives
Run to the hills, run for your lives
Run to the hills, run for your lives&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I was born into a scene
of angriness and greed
of dominance and persecution

My mother was a queen
my dad I'd never seen
I was never meant to be.

Now I spend my time
looking all around
For a man that's nowhere to
be found,
Until I find him, I'm never
gonna stop searching,
I'm gonna find my man,
gonna travel round

Cos I'm a wrathchild
Well I'm a wrathchild
Yeah I'm a wrathchild

Some say it shouldn't matter,
ain't nothing gonna alter
the course of my destination

But I know I've gotta find
some serious peace of mind
or I know I'll just go crazy.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;You walk through the subway, his eyes burn a hole in your back,
A footstep behind you, he lunges prepared for attack.
Scream for mercy, he laughs as he's watching you bleed,
Killer behind you, his blood lust defies all his needs.

My innocent victims are slaughtered with wrath and despise,
The mocking religion of hatred that burns in the night.
I have no one, I'm bound to destroy all this greed,
A voice inside me compelling to satisfy me.

I can see what a knife's meant to be,
And you'll never know how I came to forsee, see, see.

My faith in believing is stronger than lifelines and ties,
With the glimmer of metal my moment is ready to strike.

Death call arises, a scream breaks the still of the night,
Another tomorrow, remember to walk in the light!
I have found you, and now there is no place to run,
Excitement shakes me, oh God help me what have I done?!
Oooh yeah, I've done it!

You walk through the subway, my eyes burn a hole in your back,
A footstep behind you, he lunges prepared for attack.
Scream for mercy, he laughs as he's watching you bleed,
Killer behind you, my blood lust defies all my needs.
Oooh look out, I'm coming for you!&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I've been looking so long for you now you won't get away from my grasp.
You've been living so long in hiding in hiding behind that false mask
And you know and I know that you ain't got long now to last.
Your looks and your feelings are just the remains of your past.

You're standing in the wings, there you wait for the curtain to fall.
Knowing the terror and holding you have on us all.
Yeah, I know that you're gonna scratch me, maim me and maul.
You know I'm helpless from your mesmerising cat call.

Keep your distance, walk away, don't take his bait.
Don't you stray, don't fade away.
Watch your step, he's out to get you, come what may.
Don't you stray, from the narrow way.

I'm running and hiding in my dreams you're always there.
You're the Phantom of the Opera, you're the devil, you're just out to scare.
You damaged my mind and my soul it just floats through the air.
Haunt me, you taunt me, you torture me back at your lair.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

He knocks you to your feet and so what are you gonna do
Your tongue has frozen now you've got something to say
The piper at the gates of dawn is calling you his way

You watch the world exploding every single night
Dancing in the sun a newborn in the light
Say goodbye to gravity and say goodbye to death
Hello to eternity and live for every breath

Your time will come, your time will come
Your time will come, your time will come

The ferryman wants his money you ain't going to give it back
He can push his own boat as you set up off the track
Nothing you can contemplate will ever be the same
Every second is a new spark, sets the universe aflame

You watch the world exploding every single night
Dancing in the sun a newborn in the light
Brothers and their fathers joining hands and make a chain
The shadow of the Wicker Man is rising up again

Your time will come, your time will come
Your time will come, your time will come

Your time will come, your time will come
Your time will come, your time will come
Your time will come, your time will come
Your time will come, your time will come&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I have sailed to many lands, now I make my final journey
On the bow I stand, west is where I go
Through the night I plough, still my heart, calculate and pray
As the compass swings, my will is strong, I will not be led astray
Mysteries of time clouds that hide the sun
But I know, but I know, but I know

I see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost
As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost
As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea
The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me

Take my heart and set it free, carried forward by the waves
Nowhere left to run, navigator's son,
Chasing rainbows all my days

Where I go I do not know, I only know the place I've been
Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so,
Nothing's real until you feel

I steer between the crashing rocks, the sirens call my name
Lash my hands onto the helm, blood surging with the strain
I will not fail now as sunrise comes the darkness left behind
For eternity I follow on there is no other way
Mysteries of time clouds that hide the sun
But I know, I know

I see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost
As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost
As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea
The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me

Take my heart and set it free, carried forward by the waves
Nowhere left to run, Navigator's son
Chasing rainbows all my days

Where I go I do not know, I only know the place I've been
Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so
Nothing's real until you feel

I see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost
As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost
As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea
The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me

Take my heart and set it free, carried forward by the waves
Nowhere left to run, Navigator's son
Chasing rainbows all my days

Where I go I do not know, I only know the place I've been
Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so
Nothing's real until you feel&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Dying swans twisted wings, beauty not needed here
Lost my love, lost my life, in this garden of fear
I have seen many things, in a lifetime alone
Mother love is no more, bring this savage back home

Wilderness house of pain, makes no sense of it all
Close this mind dull this brain, Messiah before his fall
What you see is not real, those who know will not tell
All is lost sold your souls to this brave new world

A brave new world, in a brave new world
A brave new world, in a brave new world
In a brave new world, a brave new world
In a brave new world, a brave new world

Dragon kings dying queens, where is salvation now
Lost my life lost my dreams, rip the bones from my flesh
Silent screams laughing here, dying to tell you the truth
You are planned and you are damned in this brave new world

A brave new world, in a brave new world
A brave new world, in a brave new world
In a brave new world, a brave new world
In a brave new world, a brave new world

A brave new world, in a brave new world
A brave new world, in a brave new world
In a brave new world, a brave new world
In a brave new world, a brave new world

Dying swans twisted wings, bring this savage back home&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;And if you're taking a walk through the garden of life
What do you think you'd expect you would see?
Just like a mirror reflecting the moves of your life
And in the river reflections of me

Just for a second a glimpse of my father I see
And in a movement he beckons to me
And in a moment the memories are all that remain
And all the wounds are reopening again

We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers

And as you look all around at the world in dismay
What do you see, do you think we have learned
Not if you're taking a look at the war-torn affray
Out in the streets where the babies are burned

We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers

There are time when I feel I'm afraid for the world
There are times I'm ashamed of us all
When you're floating on all the emotion you feel
And reflecting the good and the bad

Will we ever know what the answer to life really is?
Can you really tell me what life is?
Maybe all the things that you know that are precious to you
Could be swept away by fate's own hand

We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers

When you think that we've used all our chances
And the chance to make everything right
Keep on making the same old mistakes
Makes untipping the balance so easy
When we're living our lives on the edge
Say a prayer on the book of the dead

We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers

And if you're taking a walk through the garden of life....&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Pay to kill, die to lose, hunted, hunter which are you
Diablo come again to make trophies out of men
Lose your skin, lose your skull, one by one the sack is full
In the heat dehydrate, know which breath will be your last

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, you've got to kill to stay alive
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, you've got to kill to stay alive

Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain

Human heart, human mind, intellect intertwined
Focus sharp in the night, watch the jungle burning bright
Toe to toe throw the line, everyone's caught hand tied
Iron will iron fist, how could it have come to this?

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, you've got to kill to stay live
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, you've got to kill to stay alive

Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain

Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Have you ever felt the future is the past, but you don't know how...?
A reflected dream of a captured time, is it really now, is it really happening?

Don't know why I feel this way, have I dreamt this time, this place?
Something vivid comes again into my mind
And I think I've seen your face, seen this room, been in this place
Something vivid comes again into my mind

All my hopes and expectations, looking for an explanation
Have I found my destination? I just can't take no more

The dream is true, the dream is true
The dream is true, the dream is true

Think I've heard your voice before, think I've said these words before
Something makes me feel I just might lose my mind
Am I still inside my dream? Is this a new reality
Something makes me feel that I have lost my mind

All my hopes and expectations, looking for an explanation
Coming to the realization that I can't see for sure

I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself
I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white, please save me from myself

The dream is true, the dream is true
The dream is true, the dream is true

I get up put on the light, dreading the oncoming night
Scared to fall asleep and dream the dream again
Nothing that I contemplate, nothing that I can compare
To letting loose the demons deep inside my head

Dread to think what might be stirring, that my dream is reoccurring
Got to keep away from drifting, saving me from myself

I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself
I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself

Lost in a dream of mirrors, lost in a paradox
Lost and time is spinning, lost a nightmare I retrace
Lost a hell that I revisit, lost another time and place
Lost a parallel existence, lost a nightmare I retrace

I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself
I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself

I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself
I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself

The dream is true, the dream is true
The dream is true, the dream is true&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Azazel is beside you and he's playing the game
Demons are inside you and they're making their play
Watching and they're hiding as they wait for the time
For a devil to get ready and take over your mind

You and only god would know what could be done
You and only god will know I am the only one
You and only god would know what could be done
You and only god will know I am the chosen one

Could it be it's the end of our world?
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face this all on my own
Cause I am the chosen one

Could it be it's the end of our world?
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face this all on my own
Cause I am the chosen one

Beaten fallen angel but I've risen again
And the power is inside me, I've decided to pray
As I wait for Armageddon and it's coming my way
It's an honour to be chosen and I wait for the day

You and only god would know what could be done
You and only god will know I am the only one
You and only god would know what could be done
You and only god will know that I am the chosen one

Could it be it's the end of my world?
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face all this on my own
Cause I am the chosen one

Could it be it's the end of our world?
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face this all on my own
Cause I am the chosen one

Could it be it's the end of our world?
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face this all on my own
Cause I am the chosen one

Could it be it's the end of our world?
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face this all on my own
Cause I am the chosen one&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Like a mirage riding on the desert sand
Like a vision floating with the desert winds
Know the secret of the ancient desert lands
Your are the keeper of the mystery in your hands

Nomad, rider of the ancient east
Nomad, rider that men know the least
Nomad, where you come from no one knows
Nomad, where you go to no one tells

Undercover of the veil of your disguise
The men that fear you are the ones that you despise
No one's certain what you future will behold
You're a legend you own story will be told

Nomad, rider of the ancient east
Nomad, rider that men know the least
Nomad, where you come from no one knows
Nomad, where you go to no one tells

No one dares to even look or glance your way
Your reputation goes before you they all say
Like a spirit that can disappear at will
Many claim of things but no one's seen you kill

Nomad, you're the rider so mysterious
Nomad, you're the spirit that men fear in us
Nomad, you're the rider of the desert sands
No man's ever understood your genius

Those who see you in horizon desert sun
Those who fear your reputation hide or run
You send before you a mystique that's all your own
Your silhouette is like a statue carved in stone

Nomad, you're the rider so mysterious
Nomad, you're the spirit that men fear in us
Nomad, you're the rider of the desert sands
No man ever understood your genius

Legend has it that you speak an ancient tongue
But no one's spoke to you and lived to tell the tale
Some may say that you have killed a hundred men
Others say that you have died and live again

Nomad, you're the rider so mysterious
Nomad, you're the spirit that men fear in us
Nomad, you're the rider of the desert sands
No man ever understood your genius&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are

Withered hands, withered bodies begging for salvation
Deserted by the hand of gods of their own creation
Nations cry underneath decaying skies above
You are guilty, the punishment is death for all who live
The punishment is death for all who live

Out of the silent planet, dreams of desolation
Out of the silent planet, Come the demons of creation
Out of the silent planet, dreams of desolation
Out of the silent planet, Come the demons of creation

The killing fields, the grinding wheels crushed by equilibrium
Separate lives no more disguise, no more second chances
Haggard wisdom spitting out the bitter taste of hate
I accuse you before you know the crime it's all too late
Before you know the crime it's all too late

Out of the silent planet, dreams of desolation
Out of the silent planet, Come the demons of creation
Out of the silent planet, dreams of desolation
Out of the silent planet, Come the demons of creation

Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are

Out of the silent planet, dreams of desolation
Out of the silent planet, Come the demons of creation
Out of the silent planet, dreams of desolation
Out of the silent planet, Come the demons of creation

Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;When a person turns to wrong, is it a want to be, belong?
Part of things at any cost, at what price a life is lost

At what point do we begin, fighter spirit a will to win
But what makes a man decide, take the wrong or righteous road

There's a thin line between love and hate
Wider divide that you can see between good and bad
There's a grey place between black and white
But everyone does have the right to choose the path that he takes

We all like to put the blame on society these days
But what kind of good or bad a new generation brings

Sometimes take just more than that to survive be good at heart
There is evil in some of us no matter what will never change

I will hope, my soul will fly, so I will live forever
Heart will die, my soul will fly, and I will live forever

Just a few small tears between someone happy and one sad
Just a thin line drawn between being a genius or insane

At what age begin to learn of which way out we will turn
There's a long and winding road and the trail is there to burn

There's a thin line between love and hate
Wider divide that you can see between good and bad
There's a grey place between black and white
But everyone does have the right to choose the path that he takes

I will hope, my soul will fly, so I will live forever
Heart will die, my soul will fly, and I will live forever

I will hope, my soul will fly, so I will live forever
Heart will die, my soul will fly, and I will live forever

The thin line between love and hate

The thin line between love and hate&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I'm gonna organize some changes in my life 
I'm gonna exorcise the demons of my past 
I'm gonna take the car and hit the open road 
I'm feeling ready to just open up and go 

And I just feel I can be anything 
That all I might ever wish to be 
And fantasize just what I want to be 
Make my wildest dreams come true 

I'm on my way 
Out on my own again 
I'm on my way 
Out on the road again 

When I remember back to how that things just used to be 
And I was stuck inside a shroud of misery 
I felt I'd disappeared so deep inside myself 
I couldn't find a way to break away my hell 

When I'm feeling down and low 
I vow I'll never be the same again 
I just remember what I am 
And visualize just what I'm gonna be 

I'm on my way 
Out on my own again 
I'm on my way 
Out on the road again 

I'm on my way 
Out on my own again 
I'm on my way 
I'm gonna breakaway&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;When I was wandering in the desert and was searching for the truth 
I heard a choir of angels calling out my name 
I had the feeling that my life would never be the same again 
I turned my face towards the barren sun 

And I know of the pain that you feel the same as me 
And I dream of the rain as it falls upon the leaves 
And the cracks in our lives like the cracks upon the ground 
They are sealed and are now washed away 

You tell me we can start the rain 
You tell me that we all can change 
You tell me we can find something to wash the tears away 
You tell me we can start the rain 
You tell me that we all can change 
You tell me we can find something to wash the tears...

And I know of the pain that you feel the same as me 
And I dream of the rain as it falls upon the leaves 
And the cracks in the ground like the cracks are in our lives 
They are sealed and now far away

You tell me we can start the rain 
You tell me that we all can change 
You tell me we can find something to wash the tears away 
You tell me we can start the rain 
You tell me that we all can change 
You tell me we can find something to wash the tears...

You tell me we can start the rain 
You tell me that we all can change 
You tell me we can find something to wash the tears away 
You tell me we can start the rain 
You tell me that we all can change 
You tell me we can find something to wash the tears...

And I know of the pain that you feel the same as me 
And I dream of the rain as it falls upon the leaves 
And the cracks in the ground like the cracks are in our lives 
They are sealed and now far away&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;There's a darkened sky before me 
There's no time to prepare 
Salvage a last horizon 
But no regrets from me 

Maybe I'll be back some other day 
To live again just who can say 
In what shape or form that I might be 
Just another chance for me 

A hurried time no disgrace 
Instead of racing to conclusion 
And wishing all my life away 
No-one can stop me now 

Time is up it couldn't last 
But there's more things I'd like to do 
I'm coming back to try again 
Someday maybe I'll wait till then 

No more lies...

They're all sitting at my table 
Talking tall and drinking wine 
Their time is up just like me 
But they just don't know it yet 

So just a word of warning 
When you're in your deepest dreams
There's nothing you can hide from 
I've got my eye on you 

The clock is fast, the hour is near 
Eventful past is everclear 
My life is set, the time is here 
I think I'm coming home 

No more lies...

A hurried time, no disgrace 
Instead of racing to conclusions 
And wishing all your life away 
No-one can stop me now 

Time is up it couldn't last 
But there's more things I have to do 
I'm coming back to try again 
Don't tell me that this is the end

No more lies...&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I stand alone in this desolate space 
In death they are truly alive 
Massacred innocence, evil took place 
The angels were burning inside 

Centuries later I wonder why 
What secret they took to their grave 
Still burning heretics under our skies 
Religion's still burning inside 

[Chorus:]
At the gates and the walls of Montsegur 
Blood on the stones of the citadel 
At the gates and the walls of Montsegur 
Blood on the stones of the citadel 
At the gates and the walls of Montsegur 
Blood on the stones of the citadel 
At the gates and the walls of Montsegur 
Blood on the stones of the citadel 

As we kill them all so God will know his own 
The innocents died for the Pope on his throne 
Catholic greed and its paranoid zeal 
Curse of the grail and the blood of the cross 

Templar believers with blood on their hands 
Joined in the chorus to kill on demand 
Burned at the stake for their soul's liberty 
To stand with the cathars, to die and be free 

The book of Old Testament crippled and black 
Satan - his weapon is lust 
Leaving this evil damnation of flesh
Back to the torture of lies

The perfect ones willingly died at the stake
And all of their followers slain
As for the knowledge of God they had claimed 
Religion's still burning inside 

[Repeat chorus, 3rd verse]

Templar believers with blood on their hands 
Joined in the chorus to kill on command 
Burned at the stake for their soul's liberty 
Still running herretics under our skies

As we kill them all so God know his own 
Laugh at the darkness and in god we trust 
The eye in the triangle smiling with sin 
No passover feast for the cursed within 

Facing the sun as they went to their grave 
Burn like a dog or you live like a slave 
Death is the price for your soul's liberty 
To stand with the cathars and to die and be free&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Let me tell you a story to chill the bones 
'bout a thing that I saw 
One night wandering in the everglades 
I'd one drink but no more 

I was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight 
Gazing up at the stars 
Not aware of a presence so near to me 
Watching my every move 

Feeling scared and I fell to my knees 
As something rushed me from the trees 
Took me to an unholy place 
And that is where I fell from grace 

Then they summoned me over to join in with them 
To the dance of the dead 
Into the circle of fire I followed them 
Into the middle I was led 

As if time had stopped still I was numb with fear 
But still I wanted to go 
And the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me 
As I walked onto the coals 

And I felt I was in a trance 
And my spirit was lifted from me 
And if only someone had the chance 
To witness what happened to me 

And I danced and I pranced and I sang with them 
All had death in their eyes 
Lifeless figures, they were undead all of them 
They had ascended from hell 


As I danced with the dead my free spirit was laughing
And howling down at me 
Below my undead body just danced
The circle of dead 

Until the time came to reunite us both my spirit
Came back down to me 
I didn't know if I was alive or dead as the others
All joined in with me 

By luck then a skirmish started 
And took the attention away from me 
When they took their gaze from me 
Was the moment that I fled 

I ran like hell faster than the wind
But behind I did not glance
One thing that I did not dare
Was to look just straight ahead


When you know that your time has come around you know
You'll be prepared for it
Say your last goodbyes to everyone drink
And say a prayer for it


When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead
When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead


To this day I guess I will never know
Just why they let me go
But I'll never go dancing no more
'Til I dance with the dead&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Weaving a thread round your heart and your soul
Deceiving your eyes and delaying your goal
Ships in the night when they pass out of sight
Deliver their cargo of earthly delights

To the women and children, the souls of the dead
I've opened their book and no mercy is shed
You want forgiveness and you want it cheap
I don't give redemption rewards for the meek

Suffering evil when you pay the price of fame
There isn't a god to save you if you don't save yourself
You can't blame a madman if you go insane
Give me the strength so I carry on

&lt;i&gt;Trapped in the web - but I cut the threads
Show you the gates of tomorrow
Trapped in the web - no mercy is shed
Show you the gates of tomorrow
Trapped in the web - slaves to the dead
Show you the gates of tomorrow
Trapped in the web - but I cut the threads
Show you the gates of tomorrow&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;b&gt;! SOLO !&lt;/b&gt;

Suffering evil when you pay the price of fame
There isn't a god to save you if you don't save yourself
You can't blame a madman if you go insane
Give me the strength so I carry on


&lt;i&gt;Trapped in the web - but I cut the threads
Show you the gates of tomorrow
Trapped in the web - no mercy is shed
Show you the gates of tomorrow
Trapped in the web - slaves to the dead
Show you the gates of tomorrow
Trapped in the web - but I cut the threads
Show you the gates of tomorrow&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Bleeding you dry from the start 
The sum of my parts
To give it away 
New life in a day 
Some new Frankenstein 
Damned for all time 

Cursed by the angel who fell 
Who saves me from hell? 
And who is my god? 
And where is my soul? 
Too tired to jump too young to run 

[Bridge:]
Neverending, forever searching 
Chasing dreams, the dreams of my heart 
Always seeking, always asking 
Questions right from the start 

[Chorus:]
Out beyond the new frontier 
Playing god without mercy, without fear 
Create a beast, made a man without a soul 
Is it worth the risk - a war of god and man? 
Is it worth the risk - a war of god and man? 

I want to end my life now
But I don't know how 
Recycled again a lifetime of pain 
The spawn of a man 
The devil has planned&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;In a foreign field he lay 
Lonely soldier, unknown grave 
On his dying words he prays 
Tell the world of Paschendale 

Relive all that he's been through 
Last communion of his soul 
Rust your bullets with his tears 
Let me tell you 'bout his years 

Laying low in a blood filled trench 
Kill tim 'til my very own death 
On my face I can feel the falling rain 
Never see my friends again 

In the smoke, in the mud and lead 
Smell the fear and the feeling of dread 
Soon be time to go over the wall 
Rapid fire and the end of us all 

Whistles, shouts and more gun fire 
Lifeless bodies hang on barbed wire 
Battlefield nothing but a bloody tomb 
Be reunited with my dead friends soon 

Many soldiers eighteen years 
Drown in mud, no more tears 
Surely a war no-one can win 
Killing time about to begin 

Home, far away 
From the war, a chance to live again 
Home, far away 
But the war, no chance to live again 

The bodies of ours and our foes 
The sea of death it overflows 
In no man's land, God only knows 
Into jaws of death we go 

Crucified as if on a cross 
Allied troops they mourn their loss 
German war propaganda machine 
Such before has never been seen 

Swear I heard the angels cry 
Pray to god no more may die 
So that people know the truth 
Tell the tale of Paschendale 

Cruelty has a human heart 
Every man does play his part 
Terror of the men we kill 
The human heart is hungry still 

I stand my ground for the very last time 
Gun is ready as I stand in line 
Nervous wait for the whistle to blow 
Rush of blood and over we go 

Blood is falling like the rain 
Its crimson cloak unveils again 
The sound of guns can't hide their shame 
And so we die on Paschendale 

Dodging shrapnel and barbed wire 
Running straight at the cannon fire 
Running blind as I hold my breath 
Say a prayer symphony of death 

As we charge the enemy lines 
A burst of fire and we go down 
I choke a cry but no-one hears 
Fell the blood go down my throat 

Home, far away 
From the war, a chance to live again 
Home, far away 
But the war, no chance to live again 

See my spirit on the wind 
Across the lines, beyond the hill 
Friend and foe will meet again 
Those who died at Paschendale&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Everybody's waiting for something to happen 
Everybody's waiting for something to see 
Lunatics waiting for bigger disasters 
Everyone's waiting for news on TV 

Winding lives at the end of the spiral 
Waiting dictators with their next big thrill 
Everyone's looking, but no one is listening 
Everybody wants to be in at the kill 

I wait for the signs, they tell me true 
I see the signs of the end of time 

Everyone's searching, but nothing's revealing 
Everyone's looking for the reason why 
Everyone's hoping for life everafter 
Everyone's looking at death from the sky 

Everyone's nightmares are going to happen 
Everybody's ripping the mask from their eyes 
Everyone's praying but no one's believing 
Everyone's heroes tell everyone's lies 

I wait for the signs, they tell me true 
I see the signs of the end

[Chorus:]
So I watch and I wait 
And I pray for an answer 
An end to the strife and the world's misery 
But the end never came 
And we're digging the graves 
And we're loading the guns for the kill 

Can the end be at hand? 
Is the face in the sand
Future memory of our tragedy?
Can the end be at hand? 
Is the face in the sand
Future memory of our tragedy?&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I can't be compromising in my thoughts no more 
I can't prevent the times my anger fills my heart 
I can't be sympathizing with a new lost cause 
I feel I've lost my patience with the world and all 

And all the politicians and their hollow promises 
And all the lies, deceit and shame that goes with it 
The working man pays everything for their mistakes 
And with his life too if there was to be a war 

[Chorus:]
So we can only get one chance, can we take it?
And we only got one life, can't exchange it
Can we hold on to what we have, don't replace it 
The age of innocence is fading like an old dream 

A life of petty crime gets punished with a holiday 
The victims' mind are scarred for life most everyday 
Assailants know just how much further they can go 
They know the laws are soft, conviction chances low 

[Repeat chorus]

You can't protect yourselves even in your own home 
For fear of vigilante cries, the victims wipe their eyes 
So now the criminal they launch right in our face 
Judical system lets them do it, a disgrace 

Despondent public worries, where it will all end?
We can't protect ourselves, our kids from the crime trend 
We cannot even warn each other of evil in our midst 
They have more rights than us, you cannot call that just&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;From the red sky of the east
To the sunset in the west
We have cheated death
And he has cheated us

But that was just a dream
And this is what it means
We are sleeping
And we'll dream for evermore

And the fragment remains of our memories
And the shadows remain with our hands
Deep grey, came to mourn
All the colours of the dawn
Will this journeyman's day be his last?

[Chorus:]
I know what I want
And I say what I want
And no one can take it away
I know what I want
And I say what I want
And no one can take it away

But the memory still remains
All the past years not so stange
Our winter times are like a silent shroud
And the heartbeat of the day
Drives the mist away
And winter's not the only dream around

In your life you may choose desolation
And the shadows you build with your hands
If you turn to the light
That is burning in the night
Then the journeyman's day has begun&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Won't you come into my room, I wanna show you all my wares.
I just want to see your blood, I just want to stand and stare.
See the blood begin to flow as it falls upon the floor.
Iron Maiden can't be faught, Iron Maiden can't be sought.

[Chorus]
Oh Well, wherever, wherever you are,
Iron Maiden's gonna get you, no matter how far.
See the blood flow watching it shed up above my head.
Iron Maiden wants you for dead.

Won't you come into my room, I wanna show you all my wares.
I just want to see your blood, I just want to stand and stare.
See the blood begin to flow as it falls upon the floor.
Iron Maiden can't be fought, Iron Maiden can't be sought.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I'm running of my time, I'm running out of breath
And now it's getting ,so I can't sleep at night
in the day, I feel like death

I'm getting in far too deep, I feel they closing in
I've got to say that I'm scared,I know they'll win
Even so, I prepeared

[Chorus:]
Do you believe, what you hear
Can you believe, what you see
Do you believe, what you feel
Can you believe

What is real ?
Futureal
What is real ?
Futureal

Wherever anyone seems to treat me like a freak
It makes me see I'm only one who feels
That I know that is real

Sometimes it feels like a game of deadly hide and seek
And when you reading this, then I will be gone
Maybe then, you will see&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Into the Abyss I'll fall - the eye of Horus
Into the eyes of the night - watching me go
Green is the cat's eye that glows -
in this Temple
Enter the risen Osiris - risen again.

[Chorus:]
Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave
I don't wanna die, I'm a God,
why can't I live on?
When the Live Giver dies,
all around is laid waste,
And in my last hour,
I'm a Slave to the Power of Death.

When I was living this lie - Fear was my Game
People would worship and fall -
drop to their knees.
So bring me the blood and
red wine for the one to succeed me,
For he is a man and a God -
and He will die too.

[Chorus:]

Now I am cold but a ghost lives in my veins,
Silent the terror that reigned -
marbled in stone
Shell of man God preserved -
for a thousand ages,
But open the gates of my hell -
I will strike from the grave

[Chorus:]
Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave
I don't wanna die, I'm a God,
why can't I live on?
When the Life Giver dies,
all around is laid waste,
And in my last hour,
I'm a Slave to the Power of Death.
Slave to the Power of Death...
Slave to the Power of Death...&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Wake alone in the hills
With the wind in your face
It feels good to be proud
And be free and a race
That is part of a clan
And to live on highlands
And the air that you breathe
So pure and so clean

When alone on the hills
With the wind in your hair
With a longing to feel
Just to be free

It is right to believe
In the need to be free
It's a time when you die
And without asking why
Can't you see what they do
They are grinding us down
They are taking our land
That belongs to the clans

Not alone with a dream
Just a want to be free
With a need to belong
I am a clansman...Freedom

It's a time wrough with fear
It's a land wrough with change
Ancestors could hear
What is happening now
They would turn in their graves
They would all be ashamed
That the land of the free
Has been written in chains

And I know what I want
When is timing is right
Then I'll take what is mine
I am the clansman

And I swear to defend
And we'll fight to the end
And I swear that I'll never
Be taken alive
And I know that we'll stand
And we'll fight for our land
And I swear that my bairns
Will be born free

And I know what I want
When is timing is right
Then I'll take what is mine
I am the clansman... Freedom

No, no we can't let them take anymore
No we can't let them take anymore
We've the land of the free
Freedom

It's a time wrough with fear
It's a land wrough with change
Ancestors could hear
What is happening now
They would turn in their graves
They would all be ashamed
That the land of the free
Has been written in chains

And I know what I want 
When is timing is right
Then I'll take what is mine
I am the clansman... Freedom&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Was many years ago that I left home and came this way
I was a young man, full of hope and dreams
But now it seems to me that all is lost and
nothing gained
Sometimes things ain't what they seem
No brave new world, no brave new world
No brave new world, no brave new world

Night and day I scan horizon, sea and sky
My spirit wanders endlessly
Until the day will dawn and friends from home
discover why
Hear me calling, rescue me
Set me free, set me free
Lost in this place, and leave no trace

[Chorus:]
Stranger in a strange land
Land of ice and snow
Trapped inside this prison
Lost and far from home

One hundred years have gone and men again
they came that way
To find the answer to the mystery
They found his body lying where it fell that day
Preserved in time for all to see
No brave new world, no brave new world
Lost in this place, to leave no trace

What became of the man that started
All are gone and their souls departed
Left me here in this place
So all alone

[Chorus:]

What became of the man that started
All are gone and their souls departed
Left me here in this place
So all alone&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;We live our lives in fever
In chooking sweat of fear
In the heat of the night you can feel so much
In the heat of the night I scream &quot;Don't touch&quot;

[Chorus:]
I remember a time when we used and abused
And we fought all our battles in vain
I remember a time we thought that passion was free
In the heat of the night... bodies aflame

We live in fever...

I hear your secret heartbeat
I can hear your silent cries
The kids have lost their freedom
And nobodey cares till somebodey famous dies...

[Chorus:]

Now we live, in a world of uncertanity
Fear is the key - to what you whant to be
You don't get a say the majority gets it's way
You're outnumbered by the bastards till the day you die...&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I'd sail across the ocean,
I'd walk a hundred miles,
If I could make it to the end,
Oh, just to see a smile.

You see it in their faces,
The saddness in their tears,
The desparation and the anger,
Madness and the fear.

[Chorus]
No hope, no life, just pain and fear.
No food, no love, just greed is here.

Starvation and the hunger,
The suffering and the pain,
The agonies of all out war,
When will it come again?

The struggle for the power,
A tyrant tries again,
Just what the hell is going on?
When will it ever end?

[Chorus]

You see the full moon float,
You watch the red sun rise,
We take these things for granted,
But somewhere someone's dying.

Contaminated waters,
Pollution and decay,
Just waiting for disease to strike,
Oh will we learn someday?

No hope, no life, just pain and fear.
No food, no love, no seed, childhood's end.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;On a cold October morning
As frost lay on the ground
Waiting to make my move
I made no sound

Waiting for the mist to cover all around
I carefully picked my time then took the wall

I'm sick and tired of running
The hunger and the pain
A stop to look about then off again

Being at the wrong place
And at the wrong time
Suspected of a hit that was my crime

[Chorus:]
I am a fugitive being hunted down like game
I am a fugitive but I've got to clear my name

Always looking 'round me
Forever looking back
I'll always be a target for attack

Every morning onwards
Always on the run
Waiting for a sivght of a loaded gun

[Chorus:]

Even if I find them
And get to clear my name
I know that things can never be the same

But if I ever prove
My innocence some day
I've got to get them all to make them pay&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;There's a madman in the corner of your eye
He likes to pry-into your sunlight
He whants to burst into the street with you and I
A world of shadows and of rain
He's seen what love is...
He wants to pay you back with guilt...

[Chorus:]
He lies to you he won't let you be
He's got your Chains of misery
He won't be still till he's turned your key
He holds your Chains of misery

There's prophet in the gutter in the street
He say &quot;You're damned !&quot; - and you believe him...
He's got a vision but it shines out through your eyes
A world of hatred and fear...
He's felt what love means...
He whants to pay you back with pain

[Chorus:]

It's only love that holds the key to our hearts... only love...&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Now I'm here can you see me
'Cos I'm out on my own
When the room goes cold tell me you can feel me
..........'cos I'm here

Here I am, can you see me
Passing through, on my way
To a place I'd been to only in my dreams... before

In a world of delusion
Never turn your back on a friend
'Cause you can count your real true friends on one hand
..........through life

There are those that deceive you
There are those That'll let you down
Is there someone out there that would die for you
..........thought not

Live your life with a passion
Everything you do, do well
You only get out of life what you put in
..........so they say

In a world of confusion
People never say that what they mean
If you want a straight answer go look for one
..........right now

In a room full of strangers
Do you stand with your back to the wall
Do you sometimes feel like you're on the outside
..........looking in ?

You can make your own luck
You create your destiny
I believe you have the power if you want to
..........it's true

You can do what you want to
If you try a little bit harder
A little bit of faith goes a long way
..........it does

Are we here for a reason ?
I'd like to know just what you think
It would be nice to know what happened when we die
..........wouldn't it ?

There are some who are wise
There are some who are born naive
I believe that there are some that must have lived before
..........don't you ?

As for me, well I'm thinking
You gotta keep an open mind
But I hope that my life's not an open and shut case.

Extra Sensory Perception
Life After Death, telepathy
Can the soul live on and travel through space and time ?

You know I feel so clated
'Cause I'm about to find it out
And when I know all the answers
Maybe then I'll come back
..........to feel you in

You don't be alarmed now
If I try to contact you
If things go missing or get moved around ...it's me

And don't disbelieve it
No matter what your `friends' might say
We'll meet up again some place some way
..........one day&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Lights out - We live in a world of darkness
No doubt - Everything's up for sale
We sleep - All of the world is burning
We pray - To god for better deal
Nothing is sacred - Bak then or now
Everything's wasted...
Is that all there is ?
Can I go now ?

[Chorus:]
Judas my guide
Whisperes in the night
Judas my guide

Fight wars - Die in a blaze of glory
Come home - Meat in a plastic sack
Fall down - Better pray to your god for mercy
So kneel - and help the blade cut clean
Nothing is sacred - Back then or now
Everyone's wasted...
Is that all there is ?
Is that it now ?

I live in the black
I have no guiding light
I'm whispering in your dreams...&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;The rebel of yesterday, tommorow's fool
Who are you kidding being that cool ?

Trying to break away from running with the pack
But they ain't listening so you've gotta go back

You're a weekend warrior when you're one of the crowd
But it's over, just look at you now...

You're not so brave the way you behave
It makes you sick, gotta get out quick
It's all bravado when you're out with your mates
It's like a different person goes through those gates
And the game begins, the adrenalin's high
Feel the tension maybe someone will die...

[Chorus:]
A weekend warrior lately
A weekend warrior sometimes
A weekend warrior maybe you ain't that way anymore

You've gotta get out gotta get away
But you're in with a cligue it's not easy to stray
You've gotta admit you're just living a lie
It didn't take long to workout why

It's hard to say why you got involved
Just waiting to be part, just waiting to belong...

[Chorus:]

Some of the things that you've done you feel so ashamed
After all it's only a game... isn't it ?
And after all the adrenalin's gone
What you gonna do on monday ?

A weekend warrior lately
A weekend warrior sometimes
A weekend warrior maybe you were never like that at all.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;The only place where you can dream, living here is not what it seems.
Ship of white light in the sky, nobody there to reason why.
Here I am, I'm not really there, smiling faces ever so rare.
A let's walk in deepest space, living here just isn't the place.

Stalks of light come from the ground, when I cry there isn't a sound.
All my feelings cannot be held, I'm happy in my new strange world.
Shades of green grasses twine, girls drinking plasma wine.
A look at love, a dream unfolds, living here, you'll never grow old.

Don't you hear me call? Ooh&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Giving a swish with your arse in the air
Don't you know what they're saying?
Charlotte, you're so refined when you take
All the love that they're giving.
Sticking with every man that you find,
Don't you know what they're after?
Charlotte you've got your legs in the air,
Don't you hear all the laughter?

Charlotte the Harlot, show me your legs,
Charlotte the Harlot, take me to bed.
Charlotte the Harlot, let me see blood,
Charlotte the Harlot, let me see love.

Taking so many men to your room,
Don't you feel no remorse?
You charge them a &quot;fiver&quot; (it's only for starters)
And ten for the main course.
And you've got no feelings, they died long ago,
Don't you care who you let in?
And don't you know you're breaking the law
With the service you're giving?

Charlotte the Harlot, show me your legs,
Charlotte the Harlot, take me to bed.
Charlotte the Harlot, let me see blood,
Charlotte the Harlot, let me see love.

There was a time when you left me standing there,
Picking up pieces of love off the floor.
Well, Charlotte, you left me alone in there
To make your ends as a bloody whore.
Well, Charlotte, you told me you love me true,
Picking up pieces of love yesterday.
Well, Charlotte, you're drawers are off color too
'Cause you're making love all day.

Giving a swish with your arse in the air
Don't you know what they're saying?
Charlotte, you're so refined when you take
All the love that they're giving.
Sticking with every man that you find,
Don't you know what they're after?
Charlotte you've got your legs in the air,
Don't you hear all the laughter?

Charlotte the Harlot, show me your legs,
Charlotte the Harlot, take me to bed.
Charlotte the Harlot, let me see blood,
Charlotte the Harlot, let me see love.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I remember it as plain as day
Although it happened in the dark of the night.
I was strolling through the streets of Paris
and it was cold it was starting to rain.
And then I heard a piercing scream
And I rushed to the scene of the crime.
But all I found was the butchered remains
Of two girls laying side by side.

Murders in the Rue Morgue,
Someone call the Gendarmes.
Murders in the Rue Morgue,
Flee before the killers go free.

There's some people coming down the street,
At last there's someone heard my call.
I can't understand why they're pointing at me;
I never done nothing at all.
But I must have got some blood on my hands
Because everyone's shouting at me.
I can't speak French so I couldn't explain,
And like a fool I started running away.

Murders in the Rue Morgue,
Someone call the Gendarmes.
Murders in the Rue Morgue,
Am I ever gonna be free?

And now I've gotta get away from the arms of the law.
All of France is looking for me.
I've gotta find my way across the border for sure,
Down the south to Italy.

Murders in the Rue Morgue,
Someone call the Gendarmes.
Murders in the Rue Morgue,
I'm never going home.

Well, I made it to the border at last,
But I can't erase the scene from my mind.
Anytime somebody stares at me,
Well, I just start running blind.
Well, I'm moving through the shadows at night
Away from the all the staring eyes.
Any day they'll be looking for me
'Cause I know I show the signs of...

Murders in the Rue Morgue,
Someone call the Gendarmes.
Murders in the Rue Morgue,
Running from the arms of the law.

Murders in the Rue Morgue,
Someone call the Gendarmes.
Murders in the Rue Morgue,
Am I ever gonna be free?

It took so long and I'm getting so tired,
I'm running out of places to hide.
Should I return to the scene of the crime
Where the two young victims died?
If I could go to somebody for help
It'd get me out of trouble for sure,
But I know that it's on my mind
That my doctor said I've done it before.

Murders in the Rue Morgue,
Someone call the Gendarmes.
Murders in the Rue Morgue,
I'm never going home.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;As I lay here lying on my bed, sweet voices come into my head.
Oh what it is, I wanna know, please won't you tell me it's got to go.
There's a feeling that's inside me, telling me to get away.
But I'm so tired of living, I might as well end today.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;My life is so empty, nothing to live for.
My mind is all confusion, 'cos I defied the law.
When you weren't there to help me, I lost my mind and ran.
I never had no trouble before this all began.

I'm running away, no where to go.
I'm lost and tired and I just don't know. Yeah...
They say I killed a woman, they know it isn't true.
They're just trying to frame me, and all because of you. Yeah...&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Listen to me Lamia, listen to what I've got to say.
I've got these feelings, and they won't go away.
I've got these fears inside that'll bring me to my knees.
Oh help me Lamia or I'm sure I'll die, oh please.

I feel unsettled, now I know that I've done wrong.
I've messed around with mystic things and magic for too long.
I feel I'm being paid with this nightmare inside me,
The devil's got a hold on my soul and he just won't let me be.

I'm on my knees, oh help me please.
I'm on my knees, help me please.

Oh Lamia please try to help me.
The devil's got a hold of my soul and he won't let me be.
Lamia I've got this curse, I'm turning to bad.
The devil's got a hold of my soul, and it's driving me mad. Oh

Oh Lamia please try to help me.
The devil's got a hold of my soul and he won't let me be.
Lamia I've got this curse, I'm turning to bad.
The devil's got a hold of my soul, and it's driving me mad. Oh&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Thinking of an age old dream,
Places I have never seen,
Fantasies lived times before.
I split my brain, melt through the floor.

Over clouds my mind will fly,
Forever now I can't think why.
My body tries to leave my soul,
Or is it me? I just don't know.

Mem'ries rising from the past, 
The future's shadow's overcast.
Something's clutching at my head,
Through the darkness I'll be led.

Oh another time, another place.
I'll wear another smile on another face.
When you see me floating up beside you,
You get the feeling that all my love's inside of you.

Please take me away, take me away, so far away.
Please take me away, take me away, so far away.
Please take me away, take me away, so far away.

&lt;lyrics&gt;She lays in bed at night and that is when I make my call.
But when she stares at me, she can't see nothing at all,
Because you see I can't take no shape or form.
It's been three long years since I've been gone.

I can't get used to purgatory, you know it really makes me cry,
I'll never know the reason why I had to go.

I'm crying,
Deep inside me,
Can't you see me?
Can't you see me?

I'm looking forward to her spirit coming over to me.
I feel so tempted to bring her over to see,
Just what it's like to be hanging on the other side.
I feel so lonely, it's a long time since I died.

I try to show her that she's never gonna be alone,
Because my spirit is imprisoned in the Twilight Zone.

I'm crying,
Can't you hear me?
Can't you see me?&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;&quot;O God of Earth and Altar,
Bow down and hear our cry,
Our earthly rulers falter,
Our people drift and die,
The walls of gold entomb us,
The swords of scorn divide,
Take not thy thunder from us,
But take away our pride.&quot;
[G.K Chesterton: English Hymnal]

Just a babe in a black abyss,
No reason for a place like this,
The walls are cold and souls cry out in pain,
An easy way for the blind to go,
A clever path for the fools who know
The Secret of the Hanged Man - the smile on his lips.

The light of the Blind - you'll see,
The venom that tears my spine,
The Eyes of the Nile are opening - you'll see.

She came to me with a serpent's kiss,
As the Eye of the Sun rose on her lips,
Moonlight catches silver tears I cry,
So we lay in a black embrace,
And the Seed is sown in a holy place
And I watched, and I waited for the Dawn.

The light of the Blind - you'll see,
The venom that tears my spine,
The Eyes of the Nile are opening - you'll see.

Blind all of us together,
Ablaze with Hope and Free,
No storm or heavy weather
Will rock the boat you'll see.
The time has come to close your eyes
And still the wind and rain,
For the one who will be King
Is the Watcher in the Ring.
It is You.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;As the sun breaks, above the ground,
An old man stands on the hill.
As the ground warms, to the first rays of light
A birdsong shatters the still.

His eyes are ablaze,
See the madman in his gaze.

Fly on your way, like an eagle,
Fly as high as the sun,
On your way, like an eagle,
Fly and touch the sun.

Now the crowd breaks and young boy appears
Looks the old man in the eye
As he spreads his wings and shouts at the crowd
In the name of God my father I fly.

His eyes seem so glazed
As he flies on the wings of a dream.
Now he knows his father betrayed
Now his wings turn to ashes to ashes his grave

Fly, on your way, like an eagle,
Fly as high as the sun,
On your way, like an eagle,
Fly as high as the sun.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Hear the rime of the Ancient Mariner
See his eye as he stops one of three
Mesmerises one of the wedding guests
Stay here and listen the nightmares
of the Sea.

And the music plays on, as the bride passes by
Caught by his spell and
the Mariner tells his tale.

Driven south to the land of the snow and ice
To a place where nobody's been
Through the snow fog flies on the albatross
Hailed in God's name,
hoping good luck it brings.

And the ship sails on, back to the North
Through the fog and ice and
the albatross follows on

The mariner kills the bird of good omen
His shipmates cry against what he's done
But when the fog clears, they justify him
And make themselves a part of the crime.

Sailing on and on and North across the sea
Sailing on and on and North 'til all is calm

The albatross begins with its vengeance
A terrible curse a thirst has begun
His shipmates blame bad luck on the Mariner
About his neck, the dead bird is hung.

And the curse goes on and on at sea
And the curse goes on and on for them and me.

&quot;Day after day, day after day,
we stuck nor breath nor motion
As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean
Water, water everywhere and
all the boards did shrink
Water, water everywhere nor any drop to drink.&quot;
[SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE(1798-1834)]

There, calls the Mariner,
there comes a ship over the line
But how can she sail with no wind
in her sails and no tide.

See...onward she comes
Onward she nears, out of the sun
See...she has no crew
She has no life, wait but there's two.

Death and she Life in Death.
they throw their dice for the crew
She wins the Mariner and he belong to her now.
Then...crew one by one
They drop down dead, two hundred men
She...She Life in Death.
She lets him live, her chosen one.

[Narrative]
&quot;One after one by the star dogged moon,
too quick for groan or sigh
each turned his face with a ghastly pang,
and cursed me with his eye
four times fifty living men
(and I heard nor sigh nor groan),
with heavy thump, a lifeless lump,
they dropped down one by one.&quot;
[SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE (1798-1834)]

The curse it lives on in their eyes
The Mariner he wished he'd die
Along with the sea creatures
But they lived on, so did he.

And by the light of the moon
He prays for their beauty not doom
With heart he blesses them
God's creatures all of them too.

Then the spell starts to break
The albatross falls from his neck
Sinks down like lead into the Sea
Then down in falls comes the rain.

Hear the groans of the long dead seamen
See them stir and they start to rise
Bodies lifted by good spirits
None of them speak
and they're lifeless in their eyes.

And revenge is still sought, penance starts again
Cast into a trance and the nightmare carries on.

Now the curse is finally lifted
And the Mariner sights his home
Spirits go from the long dead bodies
Form their light and
the Mariner's left alone.

And then a boat came sailing towards him
It was a joy he could not believe
The Pilot's boat, his son and the hermit.
Penance of life will fall onto Him.

And the ship it sinks like lead into the sea
And the hermit shrieves the mariner of his sins.

The Mariner's bound to tell of his story
To tell his tale wherever he goes
To teach God's word by his own example
That we must love all things that God made.

And the wedding guest's a sad and wiser man
And the tale goes on and on and on...and on&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;If you're feeling down, depressed, and lonely
I know a place where we can go:
22 Acacia Avenue,
Meet a lady that I know.

So if you're looking for a good time
And you're prepared to pay the price,
Fifteen quid is all she asks for.
Everybody's got their vice.

If you're waiting for a long time
For the rest to do their piece,
You can tell her that you know me.
You might even get it free.

So any time you're down the East End,
Don't you hesitate to go.
You can take my honest word for it:
She'll teach you more than you can know.

Charlotte, can't you get out from all of this madness?
Can't you see it only brings you sadness?
When you entertain your men
Don't you know the risk of getting disease?

Some day when you're reaching the age of forty
I bet you'll regret the days when you were laying!
Nobody then will want to know
You won't have any beautiful wares to show any more.

22, the avenue,
That's the place where we all go.
You will find it's warm inside
Red light's burning bright tonight.

Charlotte isn't it time you stopped this mad life?
Don't you ever think about the bad times?
Why do you have to live this way?
Do you enjoy your lay or is it the pay?

Sometimes when you're strolling down the avenue,
The way you walk it makes men think of having you.
When you're walking down the street
Everybody stops and turns to stare at you.

22, the avenue,
That's the place where we all go.
You will find it's warm inside
Red light's burning bright tonight.

Beat her, mistreat her, do anything that you please.
Bite her, excite her, make her get down on her knees.
Abuse her, misuse her, she can take all that you've got.
Caress her, molest her, she always doest what you want.

You're running away, don't you know what you're doing?
Can't you see it'll lead you to ruin?
Charlotte, you've taken your life and you've thrown it away.

You believe that because what you're earning
Your life's good - don't you know that you're hurting?
All the people that love you don't cast them aside.

All the men that are constantly drooling;
It's no life for you - stop all that screwing!
You're packing your bags; you're coming with me.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;He's walking like a small child
But watch his eyes burn you away
Black holes in his golden stare
God knows he wants to go home
Children of The Damned
[repeat another 3 times]

He's walking like a dead man
If he had lived he would crucified us all
Now he's standing on his last step
He thought oblivion well it beckons us all
Children of The Damned
[repeat 3 times]

Now it's burning his hands he's turning to laugh
Smiles as the flame sears the flesh
Melting his face screaming in pain
Peeling the skin from his eyes
Watch him die according to plan
He's dust on ground what did we learn

You're Children of The Damned
Your back's against the wall
You turn into the light
You're burning in the night
You're Children of The Damned
Like candles watch them burn
Burning in the light
You'll burn again tonight
You're Children of The Damned&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Another Prophet of Disaster
Who says the ship is lost,
Another Prophet of Disaster
Leaving you to count the cost.
Taunting us with Visions,
Afflicting us with fear,
Predicting War for millions,
In the hope that one appears.

No point asking when it is,
No point asking who's to go,
No point asking what's the game,
No point asking who's to blame,
'Cos if you're gonna die, if you're gonna die,
'Cos if you're gonna die, if you're gonna die,

If you're gonna die, die with your boots on,
If you're gonna try, just stick around,
Gonna cry, just move along,
If you're gonna die, if you're gonna die.

In 13 the Beast is Rising,
The Frenchman did surmise,
Through earthquakes and starvation,
The Warlord will arise,
Terror, Death, Destruction,
Pour from the Eastern sands,
But the truth of all predictions,
Is always in your hands.

If you're gonna die, die with your boots on,
If you're gonna try, just stick around,
Gonna cry, just move along,
If you're gonna die, if you're gonna die.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;There are times when I've wondered
And times when I've cried
When my prayers they were answered
At times when I've lied
But if you asked me a question
Would I tell you the truth
Now there's something to bet on
You've got nothing to lose

When I've sat by the window
And gazed at the rain
With an ache in my heart
But never feeling the pain
And if you would tell me
Just what my life means
Walking a long road
Never reaching the end

God give me the answer to my life
God give me the answer to my dreams
God give me the answer to my prayers
God give me the answer to my being&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;When it all comes down the line,
And the lights they turn to greed
And you race off with your tires screaming
Rolling Thunder,
And the people choke with poison
Children cry in fear
But you've got your fast bullet,
One way ticket outta here

[Chorus]
Fall on your knees today
And pray the world will mend its way
Get to your feet again
Refugees from the heartbreak and the pain

In the cities in the streets
There's a tension you can feel
The breaking strain is fast approaching
Guns and Riots
Politicians gamble and lie to save their skins
And the Press get fed the scapegoats
Public Enema number one

[Chorus]

A million network slaves
In an advertising new age
I don't need a crystal ball to sell ya
Your children have more brains
Than your drug infested remains
California dreaming as the Earth dies screaming&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Why is it some of us are destined to stay alive
And some of us are here just so that we'll die
How come the bullet hits the other guy
Do we have to try and reason why

[Chorus]
Be it the Devil or be it him
You can count on just one thing
When the time is up you'll know
Not just one power runs the show

Are we the lucky ones saved for another day
Or they the lucky ones who are taken away
Is it a hand on your shoulder from the Lord above
Or the Devil himself come to give you a shove.

[Chorus]

A volcano erupts and sweeps a town away
A hurricane devastates the cities in its way
The grief and misery for the ones that are left behind
The worst is yet to come a hell to face mankind&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Now the contracts out
They've put the word about
I'm coming after you

It's not the money I make
It's the thrill of the chase
And I'm coming after you

I watch your every move
Study the things you do
And the pattern of your ways

I watch the way you walk
I hear your telephone talk
I want to understand the way you think

[Chorus]
Better watch out, cos I'm the Assassin
Better watch out, Better watch out
Assassin

I'm in a cold cold sweat
I taste the smell of death
I know the moment's getting closer

And as you walk to the light
I feel my hands go tight
Excitement running through my veins

I've got you in my sights
I've got you dead to rights
The triggers waiting for my finger

I feel adrenalin rush
It's just the final touch
You can kiss your arse goodbye&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;The convoy lights are dead ahead
The Merchantmen lay in their bed,
The trump of... diesels hammers down,
In the oily sea - the killing ground,
His knuckles white his eyes alight,
He slams the hatch on the deadly night,
A cunning fox in the chickens lair
A hound of hell and the devil don't care

[Chorus]
Running silent, Running deep, we are your final prayer,
Warriors in secret sleep, a merchantman's nightmare,
A silent death lies waiting, for all of you below,
Running silent, Running deep, sink into your final sleep

Chill the hearts of fighting men,
In open ocean wondering when?
The lethal silver fish will fly
The boat will shiver - men will die
A cast of millions - a part to play
Killer? Victim? or fool for a day
Obeying an order - men have to die
Us or them - a well rehearsed lie

[Chorus]

The lifeboats shattered the hull is torn,
The tar black smell of burning oil,
On the way down to Davy Jones,
Every man for himself - you're on your own
The wolf eyes watch the crosswire
&quot;Stern tubes ready&quot;, &quot;Aim and fire!&quot;
They can pin some medal on your chest,
But in two more weeks - dead like the rest&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I got the keys to view at number 22
Behind my Green door there's nothing to see
Stone cold sober and sitting in silence, laid
back and looking for sympathy
I like a girl who knows where she's bound
I don't like girls who've been hanging around

[Chorus]
Hooks in you, hooks in me, hooks in the ceiling
For that well hung feeling
No big deal, no big sin, strung up on love I
Got the hooks screwed in

[Chorus]

She's tied up she can't come to the phone,
You must have got your wires crossed cos she ain't home
Knock on wood - you know I like that sound
She never could keep her feet on the ground

[Chorus]

Hooks in you, I've got those hooks in you
Hooks in you, in you

Right on the money got it wrapped up tight
New ideas for the decor tonight
Gonna make this house a preservation zone
Gonna set her in concrete set her up on her own&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Honey it's getting close to midnight
And all the myths are still in town
True love and lipstick on your linen
Bite the pillow make no sound
If there's some living to be done
Before your life becomes your tomb
You'd better know that I'm the one
So unchain your back door invite me around

[Chorus]
Bring your daughter, bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go

Honey it's getting close to daybreak
The sun is creeping in the sky
No patent remedies for heartache
Just empty words and humble pie
So get down on your knees honey
Assume an attitude
You just pray that I'll be waiting
Cos you know I'm coming soon

So pick up your foolish pride, no going back
No where, no way, no place to hide&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Mother Russia how are you sleeping
Middle winter cold winds blow
From the trees the snowflakes drifting
Swirling round like ghosts in the snow

Mother Russia poetry majestic
Tells the time of a great empire
Turning round the old man ponders
Reminiscing an age gone by

Mother Russia
Dance of the Tsars
Hold up your heads
Be proud of what you are
Now it has come
Freedom at last
Turning the tides of history
And your past

Mother Russia
Dance of the Tsars
Hold up your heads
Remember who you are
Can you release
The anger the grief
Can you be happy
Now your people are free&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Longboats have been sighted the evidence of war has begun
Many Nordic fighting men their swords and shields all gleam in the sun
Call to arms defend yourselves get ready to stand and fight for your lives
Judgement day has come around so be prepared don't run stand your ground

They're coming in from the sea
they've come the enemy
beneath the blazing sun
the battle has to be won
Invaders ... Pillaging
Invaders ... Looting

Set ablaze the campfires alert the other men from inland
Warning must be given there's not enough men here for a stand
The Vikings are too many too powerful to take on our own
We must have reinforcements we cannot fight this battle alone

They're coming over the hill
they've come to attack
they're coming in for the kill
there's no turning back
Invaders ... Fighting
Invaders ... Marauding

Axes grind and maces clash as wounded fighters fall to the ground
Severed limbs and fatal woundings bloody corpses lay all around
The smell of death and burning flesh the battle weary light to the end
The Saxons have been overpowered victims of the mighty Norsemen

You'd better scatter and run
the battle's lost and not won
you'd better get away
to fight another day
Invaders ... Raping
Invaders ... Plundering&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Shadows may hide you but also may be your grave
You're running today maybe tomorrow you'll be saved
You pray for daylight to save you for a while
You wonder if your children will face the killer's smile

Dead men - tell no tales
In Gangland - murders up for sale
Dead men - tell no tales
In Gangland - where jail birds die

Face at the window leers into your own
But it's only your reflection still you tremble in your bones
How long can you hide? How long 'till they come?
A rat in a trap but you've got to survive

Once you were glad to be free for a while
The air tasted good and the world was your friend
Then came the day when the hard times began
Now you're alone but alive for how long?

Dead men - tell no tales
In Gangland - murders up for sale
Dead men - tell no tales
In Gangland - where jail birds die

A knife at your throat another body on the pile
A contract to keep and it's service with a smile
Murder for vengeance or murder for gain
Death on the streets or a blacked out jail

Dead men - tell no tales
In Gangland - murders up for sale
Dead men - tell no tales
In Gangland - where jail birds die

In Gangland you tell no tales&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Cold as steel the darkness waits its hour will come.
A cry of fear from our children worshipping the sun.
Mother natures' black revenge on those who wasted her life.
War babies in the garden of Eden,
Shall turn our ashes to ice.

Sunrise has gone, freezing up the fires.
Sunrise has gone, numbing our desires.

Around the world the people stop,
With terror stricken eyes.
A shadow cast upon them all,
To crush them like a fly.
In the icy rain and whiplashed seas,
There's nowhere left to run.
The hammer blows of winter fall like a hurricane.

Sunrise has gone, freezing up the fires.
Sunrise has gone, numbing our desires.

Around the world the nations wait,
For some wise word from their leading light.
You know it's not only madmen who listen to fools.
Is this the end, the millions cried,
Clutching their riches as they died.
Those who survive must weather the storm.

Gone are the days when man looked down.
They've taken away his sacred crown.
To be set free, it took so long.
It's not journey's end, it's just begun.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Take a look in the pool and what do you see
In the dark depths there faces beckoning me
Can't you see them it's plain for all to see
They were there oh I know you don't believe me.

Oh.....I've never felt so strange
But.....I'm not going insane.

I've no doubt that you think I'm off my head
You don't say but it's in your eyes instead
Hours I spend out just gazing into that pool
Something draws me there I don't know what to do.

Oh.....they drain my strength away
Oh.....they're asking me to stay.

Nightmares.....spirits calling me
Nightmares.....they won't leave me be.

All my life's blood is slowly draining away
And I feel that I'm weaker every day
Somehow I know I haven't long to go
Joining them at the bottom of the pool.

Now.....I feel they are so near
I.....begin to see them clear

Nightmares.....coming all the time
Nightmares.....Will give me peace of mind.

Now it's clear and I know what I have to do
I must take you down there to look at them too
Hand in hand then we'll jump right into the pool
Can't you see not just me they want you too.

Oh.....we'll drown together
It.....will be forever.

Nightmares.....forever calling me
Nightmares.....Now we rest in peace.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;In a time when dinosaurs walked the earth
When the land was swamp and caves were home
In an age when prize possession was fire
To search for landscapes men would roam.

Then the tribes they came to steal their fire
And the wolves they howled into the night
As they fought a vicious angry battle
to save the power of warmth and light.

Drawn by Quest for fire
They searched all through the land
Drawn by Quest for fire
Discovery of man.

And they thought that when the embers died away
That the flame of life had burnt and died
Didn't know the sparks that made the fire
Were made by rubbing stick and stone.

So they ploughed through forest and swamps of danger
And they fought the cannibal tribes and beasts
In the search to find another fire
To regain the power of light and heat.

Drawn by Quest for fire
They searched across the land
Drawn by Quest for fire
Discovery of man.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;You killed your first man at 13,
Killer instinct, Animal supreme,
By 16 you had learned to fight
The way of the warrior, you took it as your right.

Sunlight, falling on your steel,
Death in life is your ideal,
Life is like a wheel, rolling on and on.

Through earth and water, fire and wind,
You came at last - nothing was the end,
Make a cut by fire and stones,
Take you and your blade and break you both
in two - break you both in two.

Sunlight, falling on your steel,
Death in life is your ideal,
Life is like a wheel - and it's rolling still.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;He is the King of all the land
In the Kingdom of the sands
Of a time tomorrow.

He rules the sandworms and the Fremen
In the land amongst the stars
Of an age tomorrow.

He is destined to be a King
He rules over everything
On the land called planet Dune.

Bodywater is your life
Anfd without in you would die
On the desert the planet Dune.

Without a stillsuit you would fry
On the sands so hot and dry
In a world called Arrakis.

It is a land that's rich in spice
The sandriders and the `mice'
That they call the `Muad' Dib'.

He is the Kwizatz Haderach.
He is born of Caladan
And will take the Gom Jabbar.

He has the power to forsee
Or to look into the past
He is the ruler of the stars.

The time will come for him
to lay claim his crown,
And then the foe yes
they'll be cut down,
You'll see he'll be the
best that there's been,
Messiah supreme
true leader of men,
And when the time
for judgement's at hand,
Don't fret he's strong
and he'll make a stand,
Against evil the fire
that spreads through the land,
He has the power
to make it all end.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;As a young boy chasing Dragons
with your wooden sword so mightly,
You're St. George you're David and you always
killed the beast
Times change very quickly
And you had to grow up early
A house in smiking rums and the bodies
at your feet

[Chorus:]
You'll die as you lived
In a flash of the blade
In a corner forgotten by no-one
You lived for the touch
For the feel of the steel
One man, and his Honour.

The smell of resined leather
The steely iron mask
As you cut and thrust and parried at the
fencing master's call
He taught you all he ever knew
To fear no mortal man
And now you'll wreak your vengeance in the
Screams of evil man.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;He threw down a glove you made the mistake
Of picking it up now you're gone
The choosing of guns or figthing with swords
The choise of weapons is gone
He'll tear you apart as soon as you start
You know you don't have a chance

[Chorus:]
OH...OH... Fight for the Honour
Fight for the Splendour
Fight for the Pleasure
OH...OH... Fight for the Honour
Fight for the Splendour
Fight for your Life!

Ready to start the duel begins
the best man wins in the end
A lunge and a feint, a parry too late
A cut to the chest and you're down
Seeing the stain then feeling the pain
Feeling the sweat on your brow

[Chorus:]
The fighting resumes, a silence looms the
Swordsman move 'gainst each other
A cut and a thrust, a parry, a blow
a stab to the heart and you're down
The Angel of Death hears your last breath
Meanwhile the reaper looks on

OH...OH... Fought for the Honour
Fought for the Splendour
Fought for the Pleasure
OH...OH... Fought for the Honour
Fought for the Splendour
Fought to the Death&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Turn the spotlights on the people
Sitch the dial and eat the worm
Take your chances, kill the engine
Drop your bombs and let it burn

White flags shot to ribbons,
The truce in black and burned.
Shellshock in the kitchen.
Tables overturned

[Chorus:]
Back in the village again
In the village,
I'm back in the village again.

Throwing dice now, rolling loaded
I see sixes all the way,
In a black hole and I'm spinning
As my wings get shot away.

No breaks on the inside,
Paper cats and burning barns,
There's fox among the chickens,
And a killer in the hounds.

Questions are a burden
And answers are a prison for oneself
Shellshock in the kitchen
Tables start to burn.

[Chorus:]
But still we walk into the valley
And others try to kill the inner flame
We're burning brighter and before
I don't have a number, I'M A NAME!

Back in the village again
In the village
I'm back in the village again
Back in the village again
In the village

I'm back in the village
Back in the village
Back in the village again.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

Seven ways to win
Seven holy paths to hell
And your trip begins

Seven downward slopes
Seven bloodied hopes

The fallen angel, watching you
Babylon, the scarlet whore
I'll infiltrate your gratitude
Don't you dare to save your son
Kill him now, and save the young ones
Be the mother of a birth strangled babe
Be the devil's own, Lucifer's my name

Moonchild - hear the mandrake scream
Open the seventh seal
Moonchild - You'll be mine soon child
Moonchild - take my hand tonight

I count the heads of those unborn
The accursed ones, I'll find them all
If you die by your own hand
As a suicide, you shall be damned
And if you try to save your soul,
I will torment you - you shall not grow old
With every second and passing breath
You'll be so alone, your soul will bleed to death

The twins they are exhausted, seven is the night
Gemini is rising as the red lips kiss to bite
Seven angels, seven demons battle for his soul
When Gabriel lies sleeping, this child was born to die.

One more dies, one more lives
One baby cries, one mother grieves
For all the sins, you will commit
You'll beg forgiveness, and none I'll give
A web of fear shall be your coat
To clothe you in the night
A lucky escape for now, young man
But I'll see you damned in endless night.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Infinite dreams, I can't deny them
Infinity is hard to comprehend
I couldn't hear those screams
Even in my wildest dreams

Suffocation, waking in a sweat
Scared to fall asleep again
In case the dream begins again
Someone chasing, I cannot move
Standing rigid, a nightmare's statue
What a dream, when will it end
And will I transcend?

Restless sleep, the mind's in turmoil
One nightmare ends, another fertile
It's getting to me, so scared to sleep
But scared to wake now, in too deep.

Even though it's reached new heights
I rather like the restless nights
It makes me wonder, makes me think
There's more to this, I'm on the brink
It's not the fear of what's beyond
It's just that I might not respond
I have an interest, almost craving
Would I like to get too far in?

It can't be all coincidence
Too many things are evident
You tell me you're an unbeliever?
Spiritualist? Well, me, I'm neither
But wouldn't you like to know the truth
Or what's out there, to have the proof
And find out just which side you're on
Where would you end
In Heaven or in Hell?

Help me, help me to find my true
Self without seeing the future
Save me, save me from torturing
Myself, even within my dreams

There's got to be just more to it than this
Or tell me why do we exist?
I'd like to think that when I die
I'd get a chance, another time
And to return and live again
Reincarnate, play the game again
And again and again and again.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Now that I know that the right time has come
My prediction will surely be true
The impending disaster it looms
And the whole of the village is doomed
Why won't you listen to me
Is it so hard to understand
That I am the real seventh son?
Your life or death on me depends

Suffering and pain impending disaster
Souls crying the devil's laughter
Heard the cry of the seventh whistlers
Lucifer smiles, looks on and waits

I'll take your life in my hands
Your fate, your fortune's in my visions
Heed what I say and you'll see
What will be
Please listen to me

Now that they see the disaster is done
Now they put all the blame unto me
They feel I brought on a curse
Don't they know that the torment
It stays with me, knowing that I walk alone
Through the eyes of the future I see
They don't even know what fear is
Don't they know I'm the one who is cursed

Purgatory beckons souls lost forever
Life after death or heaven hereafter
Heard the call of the seven whistlers again
Now Lucifer laughs, hell awaits

I had their lives in my hands
Their fates, their fortunes in my visions
No one beleived in my true prophecy
And now, it's too late.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;The demon in your mind will rape you in your bed at night
The wisdom of ages, the lies and outrages concealed
Time it waits for no man
My future, is revealed
Time it waits for no man
My fate is sealed

If I cancel tomorrow, the undead will thank me today
Fly in the face of your prophets, I mock your morality plays
The moon is red and bleeding
The sun is burned and black
The book of life is silent
No turning back

Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young
Only the good die young

Mystery madman, a victim of cruel charade
Some innocent pawn in an end game, one more stalemate
Is death another birthday?
A way to kiss your dreams goodbye?
Do the undead live within us?
And look through our eyes?

Walking on water - are miracles all you can trust?
Measure your coffin, does it measure up to your lust?
So I think I'll leave you
With your bishops and your guilt
So, until the next time
Have a good sin

Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young
Only the good die young

Seven deadly sins
Seven ways to win
Seven holy paths to hell

Seven downward slopes
Seven bloodied hopes
Seven are your burning fires
Seven your desires....&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;If you had the time to lose
An open mind and time to choose
Would you care to take a look
Or can you read me like a book

Time is always on my side
Time is always on my side

Can I tempt you come with me
Be Devil may care fulfill your dream
If I said I'd take you there
Would you go would you be scared

Time is always on my side
Time is always on my side

Don't be afraid you're safe with me
Safe as any soul can be... honestly
Just let yourself go

[Chorus:]
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time... oh oh
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time... oh oh

Like a wolf in sheep's clothing
You try to hide your deepest sins
Of all the things that you've done wrong
And I know where you belong

Time is always on my side
Time is always on my side

Make you an offer you can't refuse
You've only got your soul to lose...
Eternally... let yourself go!

[Chorus:]
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time... oh oh
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time
Caught now in two minds!&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Out in the street somebody's crying
Out in the night the fires burn
Maybe tonight somebody's crying
Reached the point of no return
Oh - my eyes they see but I can't believe
Oh - my heart is heavy as I turn my back and leave

[Chorus:]
Like the eagle and the dove
Fly so high on wings above
When all you see can only bring you sadness
Like a river we will flow
On towards the sea we go
When all you do can only bring you sadness
Out on the sea of madness

Somewhere I hear a voice that's calling
Out in the dark there burns a dream
You got to hope when you are falling
To find the world that you have seen
Oh - my eyes they see but I can't believe
Oh - my heart is heavy as I turn my back and leave

[Chorus:]

It's madness
The sun don't shine
On the sea of madness
There ain't no wind to fill your sails
Madness when all you see can only bring you sadness
On towards the sea we go...

Out in the street somebody's crying
Out in the night the fires burn
Maybe tonight somebody's crying
Reached the point of no return
Oh - my eyes they see but I can't believe
Oh - my heart is heavy as I turn my back and leave&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;The tough of the track
With the wind
And the rain that's beating down on
Your back
Your heart's beating loud
And goes on getting louder
And goes on even more 'til the
Sound is ringing in your head
With every step you tread
And every breath you take
Determination
Makes you run never stop
Got to win got to run 'til you drop
Keep the pace hold the race
Your mind is getting clearer
You're over half way there
But the miles they never seem to end
As if you're in a dream
Not getting anywhere
It seems so futile

[Chorus]
Run on and on
Run on and on
The loneliness of the long distance runner

I've got to keep running the course
I've got to keep running and win at
All costs
I've got to keep going be strong
Must be so determined and push myself on

Run over stiles across fields
Turn to look at who's on your heels
Way ahead of the field
The line is getting nearer but do
You want the glory that goes
You reach the final stretch
Ideals are just a trace
You feel like throwing the race
It's all so futile&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;When you see familiar faces
But you don't remember where they're from
Could you be wrong?

When you've been particular places
That you know you've never seen before
Can you be sure?

'Cause you know this has happened before
And you know that this moment in time is for real
And you know when you feel deja-vu

[Chorus:]
Feel like I've been here before
Feel like I've been here before
Feel like I've been here before
Feel like I've been here before

Ever had a conversation
That you realise you've had before
Isn't it strange

Have you ever talked to someone
And you feel you know what's coming next
It feels pre-arranged

'Cause you know that you've heard it before
And you feel that this moment in time is surreal
'Cause you know when you feel deja-vu&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;&quot;My son ask for thyself another
Kingdom, for that which I leave
is too small for thee&quot;
(King Philip of Macedonia - 339 B.C.)

Near to the east
In a part of ancient Greece
In an ancient land called Macedonia
Was born a son
To Philip of Macedon
The legend his name was Alexander

At the age of nineteen
He became the Macedon King
And he swore to free all of Asia Minor
By the Aegian Sea
In 334 B.C.
He utterly beat the armies of Persia

[Chorus:]
Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of men
Alexander the Great
Became a legend 'mongst mortal men

King Darius the third
Defeated fled Persia
The Scythians fell by the river Jaxartes
Then Egypt fell to the Macedon King as well
And he founded the city called Alexandria

By the Tigris river
He met King Darius again
And crushed him again in the battle of Arbela
Entering Babylon
And Susa, treasures he found
Took Persepolis the capital of Persia

[Chorus:]
Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of men
Alexander the Great
Became a God amongst mortal men

A Phrygian King had bound a chariot yoke
And Alexander cut the 'Gordian knot'
And legend said that who untied the knot
He would become the master of Asia

Helonism he spread far and wide
The Macedonian learned mind
Their culture was a western way of life
He paved the way for Christianity

Marching on, marching on
The battle weary marching side by side
Alexander's army line by line
They wouldn't follow him to India
Tired of the combat, pain and the glory

Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of men
Alexander the Great
He died of fever in Babylon&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I don't care for this world anymore
I just want to live my own fantasy
Faith has brought me to these shores
What was meant to be is now happening

I've found that I like this living in danger
Living on the edge it makes feel as one
Who cares now what's right or wrong it's reality
Killing so we survive wherever we may roam
Wherever we may hide we've got to get away

I don't want existence to end
We must prepare ourselves for the elements
I just want to feel like we're strong
We don't need a code of morality

I like all the mixed emotion and anger
It brings out the animal the power you can feel
And feeling so high on this much adrenalin
Excited but scary to beleive what we've become

Saints and sinners
Something within us
We are lord of the flies

Saints and sinners
Something willing us
To be lord of the flies&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;After the war and now that they've sent us homeward
I can't help but feel that I'm on my own
No one can see just what this conflict has done to
The minds of the man who are on their way home

I'm scarred for life but it's not my flesh that's wounded
So how can I face the torment alone
The vivid scenes and all the recurring nightmares
I lay there and sweat until it gets light...

People say &quot;Don't worry&quot;
Say that time's a perfect healer
That the nightmares they will come to pass
Can't hear what they're saying
I am living in my own world
And I'm feeling trance like all the time

I hear voices in my head
Could I really be going crazy
In the night the visions seem so real
Do you care if you live or die
When you laugh are you really crying
You're not sure what's feel anymore

Fortunes of war
Fortunes of war no pain anymore

Sometimes I wake
I feel that my spirit's broken
I wonder if I've the strength... to carry on.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;All my dark dreams drift like smoke in the breeze
The fear grips me as I fall towards my sleep
Here comes the nightmare that never ends
Here is the dream that makes monsters of men

In the house of my soul
In rooms of ugliness and cold
Memories locked away
All the doubts and fears I never faced

Now they come again
I am falling down to meet with them
Fears within us all
Mine awake and they stand up tall

Look for the truth
Deepest cut of all from you
Knife of the truth
Blade of haterd slicing through

I pray my sleep will break
Maybe this time I won't wake
Weakness I hide so well
This dagger in my mind will tell

It's my final stand
I make a fist out of each hand
To shadowds of the past
Take a breath and I scream attack

Look for the truth
Deepest cut of all from you
Knife of the truth
Blade of haterd slicing through

Here is the truth
Deepest cut of all from you
Knife of the truth
Blade of haterd slicing through&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Silently to silence fall
In the fields of future war
Toys of death are spitting lead
Where boys that were our soldiers bled
War horse and war machine

Curse the name of liberty
Marching on as if they should
Mix in the dirt our brothers' blood

In the mud and rain
What are we fighting for
Is it worth the pain
Is it worth dying for
Who will take the blame
Why did they make a war
Questions that come again
Should we be fighting at all

Once a ploughman hitches his team
Here he sowed ? his little dream
Now bodies arms and legs are strewn
Where mustard gas and barbwire bloom
Each moment's like a year
I've nothing legt ? inside for tears
Comrades dead or dying lie
I'm left alone asking why

In the mud and rain
What are we fighting for
Is it worth the pain
Is it worth dying for
Who will take the blame
Why did they make a war
Questions that come again
Should we be fighting at all

After the war
Left feeling no one has won
After the war
What does a soldier become

War is over and battles are gone
After the war no one has won
I'm just a soldier&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;A lonely cry for help peaching out for help to anymore
A silent prayer to god to help you on your way
I've been depressed so long
It's hard to remember when I was happy
I've felt like suicide a dozen times or more
But that's the easy way, that's the selfish way
The hardest part is to get on with your life

You're searching in the dark clutching at straws to find a way
You take the tarot cards and throw them to the wind
You ? question your beliefs your inner thoughts,
Your whole existence
And if there is a good then answer if you will
And tell me of my fate, tell me of my place
Tell me if I'll ever rest in peace

If you could live your life again
Would you change a thing or leave it all the same
If you had the chance again
Would you change the thing at all
When you look back at your past
Can you say that you are proud of what you've done
Are there times when you believe
That the right you thought was wrong

All of my life I have believed
Judgement of heaven is waiting for me

All of my life now I have believed
Judgement of heaven awaits for me...&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Sometimes it makes me wonder
Sometimes it makes me question
Sometimes it makes me saddened
Always it makes me angry but...

When you can see it happening
The madness that's all around you
Nobody seems to worry
The world seems so powerless to act...

It's out of control
Blood on the world's hands
Each day a new toll

Another assassination
The same day a new creation
But what are they coming into
Security of a world that brings...

One day another killing
Somewhere there's someone starying
Another a savage raping
Meanwhile there's someone laughing at us

It's out of control
Blood on the world's hands
Each day it goes on

Brutality and aggression
Tomorrow another lesson
Expecting another air raid
Praying for a geaserfire

They say things are getting better
No need to be complacent
There's chaos across the border
And one day it could be happening to us

It's out of control
Blood on the world's hands
It's our epitaph
It's out of control
Someone should know
Blood on the world's hands&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I've looked into the heart of darkness
Where the blood red journey ends
When you've faced the heart of darkness
Even your soul begins begins to bend

For a week I have been waiting
Still I am only in saigon
The walls moves in a little closer
I feel the jungle call me on

Every minute I get weaker
While in the jungle they grow strong
What I wanted was a mission
And for my sins they gave me one

They brought it up just like room service
'Cause everyone gets what they want
And when that mission was all over
I'd never want another one

I know, captain, that you've done this work before
We've got a problem you can help us all I'm sure
The colonel's gone rogue and methods are unsound
You'll take a per up river track, him drown

There's a conflict in every human heart
And the temptation is to take it all too far
In this war things get so confused
But there are some things which cannot be excused

He's acting [?] like a god - an insane lunatic
Your mission - exterminate with extreme prejudice
The route is dangerous and your progress may be slow
Here is the file and it's all you need to know

Here I am the knife in my hand
And now I understand why the genius must die

Now I stand alone in the darkness
With his blood upon my hands
Where sat the warrior the poet
Now lie the framents of a man&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I get in from work at 2 a.m. and sit down with beer
Turn on late night TV and then wonder why I'm here
It's meaningless and trivial and it washes over me
And once again I wonder is this all there is for me

Here I am again
Look at me again
Here I am Again
On my own
Trying hard to see
What there is for me
Here I am again
On my own

Life seems so pathetic I wish I could leave it all behind
This canvas chair, this bed, these walls that fall in on my mind
Hold on for something better
That just drags you through the dirt
Do you just let go or carry on and try to take the hurt

Here I am again
Look at me again
Here I am Again
On my own
Trying hard to see
What there is for me
Here I am again
On my own&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;When you start to take a look within
Do you feel at ease with what you see
Do you think you can have peace of mind
And have self-belief or be satisfied

Do you think you even like yourself
Or really think you could be someone else
Is there something that you'd rather be
Never thought you'd be had the chance to see

All my life I've run away
All my life I tried to hide away

Feel the paranoia creeping in
Like a cancer eating at the skin
Do you feel you've lost yourself esteem
And your self respect, what can you expect

All my life...I've run away
All my life I tried to hide away

All my life...I've run astray
Let my faith...slip away
All my life...I've run astray
Allowed my faith...to drift away

Are you scared to look inside your mind
Are you worried just at what you'll find
Do you really want to face the truth
Does it matter now, what have you got to lose

Try to release the anger from within
Forgive yourself a few immortal sins
Do you really care what people think
Are you strong enough to release the guilt

All my life...I've run away
All my life I tried to hide away

All my life...I've run astray
Let my faith...slip away
All my life...I've run astray
Allowed my faith...to drift away&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Roll of the dice
Take a spin of the wheel
Out of your hands now
So how do you feel but you're never gonna win
You'd better go back again

Do you lucky
Or do you feel scared
Take that luck brings
And the devil may care
Buit you're dowh on your luck
And what the next day bring

Adrift on the ocean
Afloat on the daydream
Or lost in a maze
Or blind in the haze
So what does it matter
So why don't you answer
So why did you send
An angel to mend

Best make decisions
Before it's too late
Take all your chances
Take all hold of the reins
A roll of the dice
Ahead of the game again

Nothing to lose
But so much to gain
A little danger
It goes without saying
But what do you care
You're gonna go in the end

Gate open to heaven
Is ready and waiting
Or straight down to hell
Can go there as well

I'll suffer my craving
My soul not worth saving
So why don't you go
Just leave well alone

Don't you think I'm a saviour
Don't you think I could save you
Don't you think I could save your life

There's like a hunger
That knocks on your door
You've had a taste of it
Still you whant more
You've made your mistakes
Won't play it same again

You have been warned
But still you plunge in
You play high stakes
But there's nothing to win
You've only one life
And so many things to learn

The angel on one side
The devil the other
Which path do you take
Decisions to make

Arrive on the crossroads
You know where you're going
And what if you wait
It maybe too late

Don't you think I'm a saviour
Don't you think I could save you
Don't you think I could save Your life&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I feel the breeze on my face in expectance
Not very long before the storm reaches here
Off in the distance the lightning is flashing again
Feel something strong as the power draws near

Is it the rolling thunder that scares you
Is it the crashing of clouds that hold fear
But all I know as I sit in a corner alone
It takes me back to my childhood again

And as I wait and look for an answer
To all the things going round in my head
I ask myself could it be a disasterand when
it's maybe threatening to happen again

As the ominous light draws near
Ther's a lone dog howls in the park
All the people hurry inside
As the lightning flash lights dark
The storm is nearly here
Only god will know

You're sitting alone you watch
As the wind is blowing treetops
And the swaying rusting of leaves
Plenty all time to perceive
As you wait for rain to fall
Only god knows
The whole sky glows

Maybe lightning strikes twice
Maybe lightning strikes Twice&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;My telescope looks out
Into the stars tonight
A little speck of light
Seems twice the size tonight
The calculations are so fine
Can it be growing all the time?

Now I can't belive it's true
And I don't know what to do
For the hundredth time
I check the declination

Now the fear starts to grow
Even my computer shows
There are no errors in the calculations

Now it's happened take no other view
Collusion course, you must believe it's true
Now there's nothing left that we can do

When Two Worlds collide
The anger and the pain
Of all those who remain
Two Worlds collide
Who will be left alive
No place to hide

When Two Worlds collide
The anger, the pain
Of those who remain
When Two Worlds collide
So who will survive
There's no place to hide
When two worlds collide

Now it's happened take no other view
Collusion course, you must believe it's true
Now there's nothing left that we can do

When Two Worlds collide
The anger,the pain
Of all those who remain
Two Worlds collide
Who will be left alive
No place to hide
There's no place to hide
When Two Worlds collide&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I am an educated fool
So I don't know what it is I'm supposed to do
About this awkward situation
That's been forced down right upon me

As I'm walking down into
On my own into the Valley of life
Got a lifetime of experience
Yeah I've got so much to give

Open the page at chapter one
Could this just be that life's just begun
Forever within your darker thoughts
Reflecting on everything you've been taught

Never felt this way before
Seems that somebody's just opened the door
To the book of life ...or is it death
Is there ever anyway out

Someone's looking down on me
To the very inner core of my soul
They won't tell me what they see
But I really whant to know

I want to leave my life on my own
I want to lift the unturned stone
I want to walk right into the fire
I want to live out all my desires
I want to go and see the fire burn
I want to see and feel my world turn
I want to know what more there's to learn
I want to pass the point of no return

Do you really wanna be
Just another statistic or feel
That you really should aspire
That you really do deserve more

Do you ever really feel
That you have so much potential inside
What you really have to give
Could be realised so much more

I want to leave my life on my own
I want to lift the unturned stone
I want to walk right into the fire
I want to live out all my desires
I want to go and see the fire burn
I want to see and feel my world turn
I want to know what more there's to learn
I want to pass the point of no return

Time will flow
And I will follow
Time will go
But I will follow

I want to feel what life's like respond
I want to meet my father beyound
I want to walk right into the light
I want to feel no fear but delight

I want to leave my life on my own
I want to lift the unturned stone
I want to walk right into the fire
I want to live out all my desires

Time will flow
And I will follow
Time will go
But I will follow&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Don't look through the eyes of a fool
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Somebody's watching when the light goes down

Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Don't look through the eyes of a fool
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Somebody's watching when the night comes down

Feel someone's watching you
You gotta get away
It is the first time
You've ever felt this scared

Feel the adrenalin pump
Your heart begins to race
Begin to run now
The sweat runs down your face

Don't know which way to run
You'd better hide yourself
He's getting closer now
You'd better improvise

Just hope you never reach
The point of no return
Could be the last time
You see the light of day

Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Don't look through the eyes of a fool
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Somebody's watching when the night comes down

Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Don't look through the eyes of a fool
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Somebody's watching when the light goes down&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Como esta amigo
For the death of those we don't know
Shall we kneel and say a prayer
They will never know we care
Shall we keep the fires burning
Shall we keep the flames alight
Should we try to remember
What is wrong and what is right

No more tears, no more tears
If we live for a hundred years
Amigos no more tears

If we do forget them and
The sacrifice they made
Will the wickedness and sadness 
Come to visit us again
Shall we dance a dance in sunlight
Shall we drink a wine of peace
Shall our tears be of joy
Shall we keep at bay the beast

No more tears, no more tears
If we live for a hundred years
Amigos no more tears

Inside the scream is silent
Inside it must remain
No victory and no vanquishment
Only horror, only pain

No more tears, no more tears
If we live for a hundred years
Amigos no more tears&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I, I'm driving black on black
Just got my license back
I got this feeling in my veins this train is coming off the track
I'll ask, polite, if the devil needs a ride
Because the angel on my right ain't hanging out with me tonight
I'm driving past, your house while you were sneaking out
I got the car door opened up so you can jump in on the run
Your mom, don't know that you were missing
She'd be pissed if she could see the parts of you that I've been kissing

Screamin'

No, we're never gonna quit
Ain't nothing wrong with it
Just acting like we're animals [animals]
No, no matter where we go
'Cause everybody knows
We're just a couple of animals [animals]

So come on baby, get in
Get in, just get in
Check out the trouble we're in

You're, beside me on the seat
Got your hand between my knees
And you control how fast we go by just how hard you wanna squeeze
It's hard, to steer, when you're breathing in my ear
But I got both hands on the wheel while you got both hands on my gears
By now, no doubt, that we were heading south
I guess nobody ever taught her not to speak with a full mouth
'Cause this, was it, like flicking on a switch
It felt so good I almost drove into the ditch
I'm screamin'

No, we're never gonna quit
Ain't nothing wrong with it
Just acting like we're animals [animals]
No, no matter where we go
'Cause everybody knows
We're just a couple of animals [animals]

So come on baby, get in
Get in, just get in
Look at the trouble we're in

We, were parked out by the tracks
We're sitting in the back
And we just started getting busy 
When she whispered &quot;what was that?&quot;
The wind, I think 'cause no one else knows where we are
And that was when she started screamin' 
&quot;That's my dad outside the car!&quot;
Oh please, the keys, they're not in the ignition
Must have wound up on the floor while 
we were switching our positions
I guess, they knew that she was missing
As I tried to tell her dad it was her mouth that I was kissing
Screamin'

No, we're never gonna quit
Ain't nothing wrong with it
Just acting like we're animals [animals]
No, no matter where we go
'Cause everybody knows
We're just a couple of animals [animals]

So come on baby, get in
We're just a couple of animals
Get in, just get in
Ain't nothing wrong with it
Check out the trouble we're in
We're just a couple of animals
Get in, just get in&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Well you can dig me up a grave
And try and stick me in the ground
Well you can tie me to the bed
And try and beat me half to death
But you can never keep me down
Well you can stick me in a hole
And you can pray all day for rain
You can shoot me in the leg
Just to try to make me beg
And you can leave me there for days 

And I'll stay alive
Just to follow you home
And I will survive
'Cause you're my Mississippi Princess
You're my California Queen
Like the Duchess of Detroit
And every city in between
You can slap me in the face
And you can scream profanity
Leave me here to die alone but
I'll still follow you home
I'll still follow you home

You can make a couple calls
And tell your brothers I'm in town
Put a bounty on my head
And tell my parents that I'm dead
And hope to hell I'm never found
You can steal me the keys
To your daddy's Cadillac
You can tamper with the brakes
Call it a mistake
And pray I'm never coming back

And I'll stay alive
Just to follow you home
And I will survive
'Cause you're my Mississippi Princess
You're my California Queen
Like the Duchess of Detroit
And every city in between
You can slap me in the face
And you can scream profanity
Leave me here to die alone but
I'll still follow you home
I'll still follow you home

You can dig me up a grave
And try and stick me in the ground
You can tie me to the bed
And try and beat me half to death
But you can never keep me down

And I will survive
'Cause you're my Mississippi Princess
You're my California Queen
Like the Duchess of Detroit
And every city in between
You can slap me in the face
And you can scream profanity
Leave me here to die alone but
I'll still follow you home
I'll still follow you home&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Well I wanted you
I wanted no one else
I thought it through
I got you to myself
You got off 
Every time you got on to me
I got caught up
In favorable slavery

[Was it wrong? Was it wrong?]

I guess it wasn't really right
I guess it wasn't meant to be
It didn't matter what they said
'Cause we were good in bed
I guess I stuck around so I could watch us fight 
for all the wrong reasons
No, it didn't matter what I tried
It's just a little hard to leave
When you're going down on me
I guess I stuck around so I could watch us fight 
For all the wrong reasons

Well you know my friends
Well they know your enemies
I'd pretend
Not to hear what they said to me
'Cause I got off
Every time you got on to me
Was it wrong
To go along with insanity?

[Was it wrong? Was it wrong?]

I guess it wasn't really right
I guess it wasn't meant to be
It didn't matter what they said
'Cause we were good in bed
I guess I stuck around so I could watch us fight 
for all the wrong reasons
No, it didn't matter what I tried
It's just a little hard to leave
When you're going down on me
I guess I stuck around so I could watch us fight 
For all the wrong reasons

I guess it wasn't what I wanted, wasn't really what I thought
Thought it was the day, I gotta want it all to go away
I guess it wasn't what I wanted, wasn't really what I thought
Thought it was the day, I gotta want it all to go away
I guess it wasn't what I wanted, wasn't really what I thought
Thought it was the day, I gotta want it all to go away
I guess it wasn't what I wanted, wasn't really what I thought
Thought it was the day, I gotta want it all to go away
I guess it wasn't what I wanted, wasn't really what I thought
Thought it was the day, I gotta want it all to go away

I guess it wasn't really right
I guess it wasn't meant to be
It didn't matter what they said
'Cause we were good in bed
I guess I stuck around so I could watch us fight 
for all the wrong reasons
No, it didn't matter what I tried
It's just a little hard to leave
When you're going down on me
I guess I stuck around so I could watch us fight 
For all the wrong reasons&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Look at this photograph
Everytime I do it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red
And what the hell is on Joey's head

And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we'd ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneaking out

And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must have done it half a dozen times

I wonder if it's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate
Life's better now then it was back then
If I was them I wouldn't let me in

Oh oh oh
Oh god I

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

[Goodbye]

Remember the old arcade
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin' out
They say somebody went and burned it down

We used to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we know
We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just the steering wheel

Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She's had a couple of kids since then
I haven't seen her since god knows when

Oh oh oh
Oh god I

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

[Goodybye]

I miss that town
I miss the faces
You can't erase
You can't replace it
I miss it now
I can't believe it
So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it

If I could I relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Look at this photograph
Everytime I do it makes me laugh
Everytime I do it makes me&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Prison gates won't open up for me
On these hands and knees I'm crawlin'
[Oh] I reach for you
Well I'm terrified of these four walls
These iron bars can't hold my soul in
[All] I need is you
[Come please I'm callin']
And oh I scream for you
[Hurry I'm fallin']
[I'm fallin']

Show me what it's like
[To be the last one standing]
And teach me wrong from right
[And I'll show you what I can be]
Say it for me
Say it to me
And I'll leave this life behind me
Say it if it's worth saving me

Heaven's gates won't open up for me
With these broken wings I'm fallin'
[And all] I see is you
These city walls ain't got no love for me
I'm on the ledge of the eighteenth story
[And oh] I scream for you
[Come please I'm callin']
And all I need from you
[Hurry I'm fallin']
[I'm fallin']

Show me what it's like
[To be the last one standing]
And teach me wrong from right
[And I'll show you what I can be]
Say it for me
Say it to me
And I'll leave this life behind me
Say it if it's worth saving me

[Hurry I'm fallin']

And all I need is you
[Come please I'm fallin']
And oh I scream for you
[Hurry I'm fallin']
[I'm fallin']

Show me what it's like
[To be the last one standing]
And teach me wrong from right
[And I'll show you what I can be]
Say it for me
Say it to me
And I'll leave this life behind me
Say it if it's worth saving me
[Hurry I'm fallin']
And say it for me
Say it to me
And I'll leave this life behind me
Say it if it's worth saving me&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;This time, this place
Misused, mistakes
Too long, too late
Who was I to make you wait
Just one chance
Just one breath
Just in case there's just one left
'Cause you know, you know, you know

That I love you
I have loved you all along
And I miss you
Been far away for far too long
I keep dreaming you'll be with me
And you'll never go
Stop breathing if
I don't see you anymore

On my knees, I'll ask
Last chance for one last dance
'Cause with you, I'd withstand
All of hell to hold your hand
I'd give it all
I'd give for us
Give anything but I won't give up
'Cause you know, you know, you know

That I love you
I have loved you all along
And I miss you
Been far away for far too long
I keep dreaming you'll be with me
And you'll never go
Stop breathing if
I don't see you anymore

So far away
[So far away]
Been far away for far too long
So far away
[So far away]
Been far away for far too long
But you know, you know, you know

I wanted
I wanted you to stay
'Cause I needed
I need to hear you say
That I love you
[I love you]
I have loved you all along
And I forgive you
[I forgive you]
For being away for far too long
So keep breathing
'Cause I'm not leaving you anymore
Believe it
Hold on to me and, never let me go

[Keep breathing]
Hold on to me and, never let me go
[Keep breathing]
Hold on to me and, never let me go&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I judge by what she's wearing
Just how many heads I'm tearing
Off of assholes coming, on to her
[Each night seems like it's getting worse]
And I wish she'd take the night off
So I don't have to fight off
Every asshole coming on to her
[It happens every night she works]
They'll go and ask the DJ
Find out just what would she say
If they all tried coming on to her
[Don't they know it's never going to work]
They think they'll get inside her
With every drink they buy her
As they all try coming on to her
[This time somebody's getting hurt]

Here comes the next contestant

Is that, your hand, on my, girlfriend?
Is that, your hand?
I wish you'd do it again
I'll watch you leave here limping
And I wish you'd do it again
I'll watch you leave here limping
There goes the next contestant

I even fear the ladies
They're cool but twice as crazy
Just as bad for coming, on to her
[Don't they know it's never going to work]
Each time she bats an eyelash
Somebody's grabbing her ass
Everyone is coming on to her
[This time somebody's getting hurt]

Here comes the next contestant

Is that, your hand, on my, girlfriend?
Is that, your hand?
I wish you'd do it again
I'll watch you leave here limping
I wish you'd do it again
I'll watch you leave here limping
There goes the next contestant

I'm hating what she's wearing
Everybody here keeps staring
Can't wait 'til they get what they deserve
[This somebody's getting hurt]

Here comes the next contestant

Is that, your hand, on my, girlfriend?
Is that, your hand?
I wish you'd do it again
[I'll watch you leave here limping]
I wish you'd do it again
[I'll watch you leave here limping]
I wish you'd do it again
[Each night seems like it's getting worse[
I wish you'd do it again
[This somebody's getting hurt]

There goes the next contestant&lt;/lyrics&gt;

It's your fault that these babies die
That I can't see through this pollution
To the sun and the moon in the sky
It's time to tear this prisons down
Or what you named these slave ships you built upon the ground
We are destroying ourselves
Compelled to sell, betrayed by our fathers
Swept aside by the dollar
You call it heaven on Earth and I'll call it Hell
Locked up in our house 
Minds wound so tight
It's become a cell, in which we dwell
Our maze, madness contagious
Cover your mouth, cause mother fuckers these days
Even sneeze crazy, insanity in the gravy
U.S. Troops are killing women and babies
Like a super villain, your evil doings are amazing
&lt;/lyrics&gt;

You talking to me? You talking to me?

It's time to gather some leaders daring
Off the Earth I'm not profit sharing
We need some solidarity, no deal's gonna carry me
I speak my own vows, you could never marry me
Like sub-commandante Marcos, I'm wed to el hente
The struggle long and hard, but my hand is steady
My right fist was the first out of the uterus
Fight the power, kill the rich, Bush is a bitch
They already got me on they damn list
For your my futurist; spark it off to get you pissed
Deliverance is the issue
Steady tongue, I wear the pants, but they won't fit you
You ready to try do the dance, and they diss you
We was compromised from get fools
No lackey no rich mans tool
Change the rules, we storm the gates with a billion troops
We'll change our fate like the last second three-point hoop

Listen you fuckers, you screw-heads
Here's a man who would not take it anymore
A man who stood up against the scum, the cunts, the dogs, the filth, the shit
Here is someone who stood up

Sometimes I speak in Spanglish 'cause I can
If I could, I would keep in one of the dialects of African
Being American is my gift and my limitation
Being poor man is the rift and the source of my frustration
A white van kidnaps my errant thoughts on the edge of my concentration
I'm standing on the ledge of manipulation.
Stock market panic is landing, in it's wake, economic devastation
Steady talking to deaf ears, emancipation
I'm ready to walk without fear of incarceration
I stand like The Rock, right here, with determination
I spit on my hand and hit you right in the face man
The plans for us to join the system was a scam
Their position is to keep the leaders on the lam

Listen you fuckers, you screw-heads
Here's a man who would not take it anymore
A man who stood up against the scum, the cunts, the dogs, the filth, the shit
Here is someone who stood up
&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Where are my comrades in this struggle? Where are my comrades in this struggle?

[Verse 1]
All my dreams are filled with greed of these things I'll never need
And these people I'll never meet, I'm steady trying to ground myself on these two feet
I guess I'm more than a wolf, then a sheep? I tend to give rather than deplete
How much more will these corrupt leaders burn on money driven lies and deceit?
How much more will these pigs spend on making us buy and desire?
how much more will these devils spend protecting their lies and fueling the fire?
I'm walking the wire, I'll stand on the soap box and call George Bush a liar
This is about economic domination and oil price manipulation
If our future is in God's hands, it's time we snatched it back, understand?

Where are my comrades in this struggle? Where are my comrades in this struggle?

[Verse 2]
Bush is steady trying to build a coalition and he's usual lap dogs ain't jumping to attention
Australia, the EU and Britain, the people are saying &quot;We Don't Want A War!&quot;
And ain't no one listening, who's really getting screwed but the poor?
All over the world, we march, chanting in the streets
from the shallow to deep, fighting for those with nada to eat
Who can trust None, Leaders or Priests? Strange to have it so good when food is so sparse, 
when so many have least united against this farce, we want change and we want peace
Protected from this wreckage, fighting the system with my dialectics
I'll follow no carrot, you lead on a stick, I'll kill no brown man for you war mongering pricks
When the people are ignored and the Government goes to war
Revolution is real politic, Revolution is real politic

Where are my comrades in this struggle, in this struggle? 
Where are my comrades in this struggle, in this struggle?
Where are my comrades in this struggle? 
Where are my comrades in this struggle?
Where are my comrades in this struggle?&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Hackers and crackers
Set the world free
From educational software to mp3
We cracked the matrix and hacked into Gates paycheck
I gave you hackers and crackers 1.0 and this is two
Tried to make a song for the newbie and the old school
And I gotta say, that even more then before—my brethren I love you

You raised me on video games, you planned for my brain to be rot
I remember when football was just grey blinking dots
You tried to make it your money-making jalopy—they slipped can't you see
I lived it all, punch card to floppy—from zip disk to DVD
We were there on—every occasion—we that are the—digital generation
Then was born the language of freedom—my mind is free on the 'net
Underground media—gathering place—trade place—of things you don't bout yet
You fucking government stooge—I'm in your base—and I'm killing your d00ds

The best is free like Linux—open source we plead—Microsoft is shit to me
You drove warez underground—but in hidden FTPs—software and music still abounds
On the IRC we trade and clown—you and the software that should be free
Some use bottler—some use catchers—every downloads means freedom to me
See movies that I would never see, listen to the music—that I would never hear
Thanks to the hackers and crackers—I see clear—raise my fist and beer
Your encryption I crack—with black pen and on PC or MAC
I pay a fair price—if I wasn't living off ramon, beans and rice
We're in your network and all over your server like mice

We won't pay for your CDs no more
Fuck the store and overpriced albums
More money for the artists—not busting us is your problem
Pay the cats who croon—fuck these exec goons—and fuck a buck a song on itunes
I got a terabyte of warez and I know just what the fuck to do
I got it on a t1 and gave the ftp to everyone--
Hit me on IM and I'll give that shit to you...

Radium you know how I feel
Thank you for making my music real
Stank—my dog for support—leading a 
Binary revolution towards our collective freedom
If you think—that operation fast—link—even made us blink
We rise like phoenix—from the ashes and flame to live again
We will remember the work of Kalisto, deviance, class, echelon, wlw, fairlight, apc and razor 1911
We retire your names in hacker/cracker heaven
Myth, keep doing what you do—we need you!
UCF and vengeance—we see you
The word crack is Phrozen—cause they keep it real

The Legion of Doom is gone--the Masters of Deception have passed on
Hacker wars are old fashioned—now we work together—make the net better
Godabuzz—got busted by the fuzz—dredwerks has gone back into the earth
Time changes and so does the year, one of the last standing was Asian warez
Props to movienight—make this your theme—and do Zearle right
Your overpriced apps I stack, two clicks, to Astalavista, and I gotta a crack

&quot;Hacker breaks into server&quot;, &quot;hacker causes downtime&quot;,
&quot;Hacker steals top secret documents and puts them online&quot;,
Don't make lame ass headlines, tell the public what it's about.
Are you mad that hackers got into your secret files? 
Or are you mad your secret files got out?
And whats up with hackers getting blamed for SPAM too?
We don't create SPAM, we hate that shit as much as YOU do!
The difference is, we don't go and cry to someone else
We go after those bastards, and handle that shit our-damn-selves!

Hackers are unbiased, we try to make this world grow.
No boundaries, no constraints, dissatisfied with the word &quot;no&quot;.
Knowledge without limits, minds that will not be controlled.
They try to stop us, but it ain't over 'til WE SAY SO!
You call us thieves and criminals. You call us terrorists!
Your kids will look back and call us Revolutionists.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Like a phoenix ignition
like a crematorium
Like a swelling volition
from the barrel of a gun
From the ashes and the embers
like a rocket I'll ascend
Like a cry gone up for a fallen friend
Like a cry gone up for a fallen..

Like a phoenix ignition
like a crematorium
Like a swelling volition
from the barrel of a gun
From the ashes and the embers
like a rocket I'll ascend
Like a cry gone up for a fallen friend
I'LL ASCEND

Everyday tear down the walls
till cornerstones remain
Coming ONE STEP CLOSER ALL THE TIME
And although we'll never reach perfection ALWAYS PERSIST TO TRY

No regrets, just rebirth
move forward, and ignite.
Incandescent Reinvention
a new renaissance
A NEW FIRE EACH DAY
A NEW FIRE EACH DAY...DAY...DAY...DAY!&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Bound to this couch, I lie in waiting 
Watching wind blown memories slip by my window sill
I can't fall asleep, voice in my head disturbs me
Waking nightmares keep, have my cries fallen on deaf ears
Can you hear me or am I....

Talking to myself again, is there anybody listening
Are you taking this in, am I wasting my breath
Tell me, is the wind in your sails worth everything you give
Are you looking for something, forgiveness

I leave it up to you, I guess I'm better off removed
Because the situtations growing too thick, 
In your hands

Could it have been something I said,
Or was it something that I did
Did I ruin my chance, have you written me off
Tell me where did i cross the line,
And can I work my way back this time
Will i always regret this decision
I leave it up to you, 
I hope you find a good excuse because 
I've given about all that i can give, 
In your hands

Are you taking this in, am I wasting my breath
Did i ruin my chance, have you written me off

[background]
I could try to count the times that I've been through this in my mind,
but i'm running out of fingers and I don't have that much time

Are you taking this in, am I wasting my breath
Did i ruin my chance, have you written me off&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;TO WHAT END!

To what end do we
proceed so boldly
if all we are is
chemical reactions
and what world have you
so deftly sold me
if you reduce me
if I have no soul to touch

no heart to love
no evil to rise up above
no angels and no ghosts
no real victories to toast
if you believe that this is true
then I must ask
to what end do you proceed?

NO FIRE IN OUR EYES
NO STEEL IN OUR HEARTS
NO MAGIC IN OUR SONGS
ARE WE JUST EMPTY VESSELS

No fire in our eyes
No steel in our hearts
No magic in our songs
[x2]

and you tell me...
I have no soul to touch
no heart to love
no evil to rise up above
no angels and no ghosts
no real victories to toast
if you believe that this is true
then I must ask
to what end do you proceed?

Did I not feel your love?
Did I not feel your hate?
And did my heart not beat
and did MY HEART NOT BREAK?!
And are these tears for naught
and are these worlds in vain
if this is all we are then what
HAVE WE TO GAIN!
What of all the art and books
music and poetry
What of all our memories
What of OUR HOPES AND DREAMS!
They hold no value then
We hold no faith but greed
So I must ask you
to what end do we proceed?&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Unabashedly pursue,
the truth that we cannot deny
A revelation shining through,
orchestration Adonai
A revolution ultra-blue,
and a melodic battle cry
And though some say there'll be no coup,
we'll never know unless we

Try to see it through,
and find a different point of view,
one where faith is not taboo
And we'll all learn to see the world as new

Sometimes a belief held true,
is proved to be an outright lie
But it seems we always knew,
in some unspoken lullaby
I'll see you at the rendezvous,
we'll raise our voices to the sky
And though some say there'll be no coup,
we'll never know unless we

Try to see it through, 
and find a different point of view,
one where faith is not taboo
And we'll all learn to see the world as new

Revolution ultra-blue [to fade]&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Only now that you have taught me
(but how late) my lack
I see the chasm
And everything you are was making
My heart into a bridge
By which I might get back
From exile and grow man
And now the bridge is breaking

For this I bless you as the ruin falls

The pain you bring
Far greater than all other gain&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Misguided satellite
I circle by habit,
can't find my orbit to save my life
I want to fall,
I want to burn,
like an ignorant craterless meteorite
Long ago I was derailed,
long ago the mission failed
but in the distance there appears a light

Disgruntled architect
building a palace
cant make it perfect to save my life
victimless crime ride the wrecking ball in
evacuate now while I breathe dynamite
Efforts all to no avail
I'm perfection's countervail
torn in pieces, I am made contrite

And in my darkest hour
the brightest light draws near to me
a torch to end all torches,
this is the light that sets me free
all shadows burn away now
but by his grace I am sustained
though all was lost,
now all is found and more is gained

Lift me up and make me whole
Instill in me a new hope
Breathe new life into my soul&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Your traps are all baited
Your scales are all weighted
But not resisting you would surely drive me insane
So im caught and convicted,
My rights are restricted
The imbecile dynasty continues to reign

Your apathy of thought
Has lead you to believe
That things are what they're not
My friend you've been decieved
The easiest route rarely leads to the truth
I see the self approval glaze your eyes
You know you're right
No need to worry why
A thousand stones remain unturned
In the wake of your unquestioned answers
And truth covered lies

Traditions some bear
Idly without out a care
But are determined that they stand unchanged
And those who choose to rebel
Just to raise up some hell
Tell me what are you hoping to gain

I cant reason with you
I speak words you can't hear
Social conditioning left you with deafened ears
So I take your face in hand
See that look in your eyes
That rigormortis stare,
That look that I despise
And so i turn from you
I walk these streets alone
Alone I search for truth
Ideal that you've disowned
And wait with fingers crossed
And pray you'll someday find
A way to see things though your own eyes&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;It's my life!
you set the bar too high
your expectations have become my failure
a shell you see so shallow but deep inside (deep inside)
my heart beats just the same as yours
the same blood through these clean veins
can't you see that I'm in pain
it seems my life is always under par

what can I say to change your mind about what I am
others can see what was hidden from your sight
a kid with courage and heart and his eyes open wide
an inner beauty and a bright light

my focus is not yours
I set my sights on new horizons and let my soul have scope
can't you see that I have my own dreams (my own dreams)
and though they're not the same as yours
they hold value to me, tell me why can't you see
I'm not the means to mend your past regrets

what can I say to change your mind about what I am
others can see what was hidden from your sight
a kid with courage and heart and his eyes open wide
an inner beauty and a bright light

judged for how I look, not for the good that I have done
I try the best I can, but it seems that I'm not the perfect son
shaped by God, and my volition
and the seeds that you have sown
but I ask you once again
when does my life become my own?

I have my own!...
Let's go!
My own...

what can I say to change your mind about what I am
others can see what was hidden from your sight
a kid with courage and heart and his eyes open wide
an inner beauty and a bright light&lt;/lyrics&gt;

All I seem to offer up are discords
And every note I sing sounds out of key
And every time I play with passion
I start breaking strings
And my voice cracks
When I sing from my heart
Guess that's the price
I've got to pay to know that I'm alive
This melody is tearing me apart
[x2]

So now what do I have to show
And what price do I have to pay
But like a saiyan I won't grow
Unless I'm battered in the fray
'Cause we're all in the same machine
Each one with his own broken dreams
Passion gives way to failure
So let's all try and understand
You take my hand and I'll take yours
You take my hand and I'll take yours
Take my hand and I'll take yours
Let our passion bleed&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Can we,
can we kill each other quickly?
Quick enough so I won't feel it?
A shot of strobe light anesthia
and I'll be fine

'Cause I'm beginning to feel cold
My hands are shaking from fear,
white from clutching my pride,
red from cutting you,
and blue from telling lies.

'Cause I'm sick of the stabbing,
I'm sick of the breaking,
I'm sick of the bleeding until we fall down,
sick of this circle of death that we dance through
again and again, just lay me in the ground.
Let's fall asleep together,
hold me darling 'cause I'm scared,
and I can't do this alone.

But I need!
your heartbeat
to haunt me,
your cold lips to breathe,
a promise that, tomorrow
we'll wake up somewhere new.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;It infiltrates,
Insidious,
It feigns at love,
Betrays our trust
In what we've known,
Since we were born.
The truth we've found in all we see

Points to design,
Still our chests swell,
We'll never find
True answers from a wishing well.

So feed us all
Another lie,
To steal our thoughts,
Appease our pride,
So we wont have
To change the way we see, we live, we love, we die,

Our lust precedes
Our blasphemy,
Our logic reads
Like notes from tainted autopsy.

Our souls they speak of something more,
But we cant look beyond ourselves.
We implore empty skies because
Our hearts hold room for no one else,

We extend our
Claws to grasp at shadows of the
Ideals we have,
Lost causalities of a subtle dagger,
Buried to the
Hilt in our hearts, blood on our hands.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I hear the waves crash far below,
The rocks are leaping for the sky,
They're starving for the air,
For a bone to break, a dream to smash apart,
But I don't care.

It looks deep enough from here, I'm diving
This cliff has been well worn by ignorance.
It looks deep enough from here, I'm diving
They float face down they all look so content.

I don't know why I'm even here.
Guess I'm afraid to be alone.
And down below I see my crew they look okay
That can't be blood the water here
Is far too blue

And gravity
Seems far away
But I can hear her call my name
It's so comforting to know I'll never have to think again

It looks deep enough from here, I'm diving
This cliff has been well worn by ignorance.
It looks deep enough from here, I'm diving
We float face down, and don't we look content?
It looks deep enough from here, I'm diving
This cliff has been well worn by ignorance.
It looks deep enough from here, I'm diving
We float face down, and don't we all look so content?
It looks deep enough from here
It looks deep enough from here&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Faith,
Is not something that I grasp
It's something that I fake,
As I'm slipping, as I'm falling through the cracks,
Faith
Without actions is a mask,
For making the same mistakes
As I'm slipping as I'm falling through the cracks.

Somehow I find beauty in our failings,
Somehow I find meaning in these lies
Somehow I'm made perfect in this fracture,
Your back is begging sweetly for my knives,

I'm spilling blood,
Glancing down to hide my face,
I walk with eyes closed tight through monuments of grace,

Somehow I find beauty in our failings,
Somehow I find meaning in these lies
Somehow I'm made perfect in this fracture,
Sour back is begging sweetly for my knives!

My faith is a front, I'm spilling blood,
Glancing down to hide my face, I walk with eyes closed
Through monuments of grace, I'm spilling blood
Glancing down to hide my face I walk with eyes closed
Through monuments of grace

Isn't it sweet how,
Trusted with angels,
And how so quickly
I break my promises?
Isn't it sweet, isn't it sweet, isn't it sweet, isn't it sweet?&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;When deadbolts awake you from deja vu dreams,
At four in the morning you know where I'll be.
Out running red lights asleep at the wheel.
The sirens feed my nightmares,

I just close my eyes and I'm already here;
Its already too late.
I know its nothing but lies,
But they sound so sincere;
I find them too hard to hate.

And she calls from the doorway &quot;stolen water is sweet,
So let's drink it in the darkness if you know what I mean&quot;
And she calls from the doorway &quot;stolen water is sweet,
So let's drink it in the darkness if you know what I mean&quot;

And I'm almost sure
That I've been here before,
That this is not the first time I've stood in front of this door,
With an overwhelming feeling that I shouldn't go in,
But it seems this is a battle that I never could win.

And you!
My true love!
You call from the hilltop.
You call through the streets,
&quot;Darling don't you know,
The water is poison.&quot;
And I say!
&quot;Come on and give me my poison.&quot;

What have I done?
Is it too late to save me from this place?
From the depths of the grave?
We all are those ..
Who thought we were brave.
What have I done?&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I want to take the bullet,
The one aimed straight for your heart,
I want to meet the wolves halfway,
And let them tear me apart.
But that's not the way they do it here.

I want to lay on the tracks,
Feel hot steel screaming at me,
Expose the bones on my back,
Let me show you what i mean.
Yeah its a different kind of love,
I want to climb barbed wire fences
And warm our hands in blood.

And this is my gift,
Is asking you to fix
My ruined hands.
And its a gift that keeps on giving,
And its a gift that keeps on giving,
And its a gift that keeps on giving,
And right now its all i have to give.

I want to lay on the tracks,
Feel hot steel screaming at me,
Expose the bones on my back,
Let me show you what i mean
I want to lay on the tracks,
Feel hot steel screaming at me,
Expose the bones on my back,
Let me show you what i mean

I want to write the perfect song,
And play it just for you,
While you are tangled up in sleep.
I need you more than ill ever know
Until i stop breathing
My lungs will take you for granted.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Entertain the hope that somehow you'll escape me
Weld the bolts and close the iron gate
Drink deeply THE ILLUSION OF YOUR SAFETY,
My how wishful thoughts inebriate,

Masquerade and revel in your opulence.
Writhe unfettered by your stabs at ignorance.
Swim through hues and whispered tones of heresy,
A dozen strokes to run your blood cold enough to believe
Remember me?

You look so surprised to see me here,
With hells black wings did i overperch these walls,
For stony limits cannot hold me out,
And now
You
All
DIE&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Love everywhere,
Exploding, maims and blinds,
A living dance upon dead minds,
Love everywhere,
Exploding, maims and blinds,
A living dance upon dead minds

But surely does not forget (perish),
Sleep, cannot be photographed (measured);
Disdains the trivial labeling of punctual brains,
But surely does not forget (perish),
Sleep, cannot be photographed (measured);
Disdains the trivial labeling of punctual brains,

Why its love;
But at the earliest spear
Of sun
Perfectly should disappear

Who wields a poem huger than the grave?
Who wields a poem huger than the grave?
Who wields a poem huger than the grave? (Who wields a poem huger than the grave?)
Who wields a poem huger than the grave? (Who wields a poem huger than the grave?)

But surely does not forget (perish),
Sleep, cannot be photographed (measured);
Disdains the trivial labeling of punctual brains,
But surely does not forget (perish),
Sleep, cannot be photographed (measured);
Disdains the trivial labeling of punctual brains,

But surely does not forget (perish),
Sleep, cannot be photographed (measured);
Disdains the trivial labeling of punctual brains,
But surely does not forget (perish),
Sleep, cannot be photographed (measured);
Disdains the trivial labeling of punctual brains,&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Our idols lay in ruins
We'd have saved them if we could
But we still choose to worship
The places where our idols stood.

Still believing
They can save us,
I've lived this way too long to turn back now

Presuppositions set in stone
This coffin sealed by my own pride,
And though it seems the sun will shine,
I'll draw the shades and stay inside.

If we've learned anything at all,
Its that the ghosts of idols will do just as well
We all see what we want to anyway [screams:] anyway

Some things
Are better left unsaid.
You know what's at stake
Something's are better left unsaid
As long as we keep it
In textbooks, then well be untouchable, untouchable
We hate to lie to children,
But after all its all
For their own good.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

You could snap my neck
Any speed you drive can be dangerous

Mix the chemicals right dear, mix the chemicals right
Yeah you know there's a fine line between
Mix the chemicals right dear, mix the chemicals right
'Cause I know what betrayal can mean

When this frame fails me
Will I trust you to carry me through?

But I know what a promise can do.

The news broadcast the funeral
500 channels focus in
Your love was
Ravished drawn and quartered,
The soil was swift to drink her blood.
This violence in the name of love!

But I still feel you,
Despite your tombstone,
But I still feel you,
Despite your tombstone,
So friend you must still walk among us,
In places we don't dare to glance
I saw you killing Aristotle
But I know it's all part of the plan.
Old friend they told me you were dead
The news broadcast the funeral
500 channels focus in
Your love was
Ravished drawn and quartered,
The soil was swift to drink her blood.
This violence in the name of love!
Old friend they told me you were dead
The news broadcast the funeral
500 channels focus in
Your love was
Ravished drawn and quartered,
The soil was swift to drink her blood.
This violence, this violence, this violence in the name of love!

&lt;lyrics&gt;So strange I remember you in protest of a prayer,
And falling back from seas we fear to sail.

I swear I saw the shooter, gold teeth and a double dare,
Postmodern warnings seem inclined to fail.

Feigning an apology.
Those words they never left your lips.
Those 5 years in Bermuda slide by like the lights of passing ships,
So strange that I remember you,
kneeling deep in Nietzsche's lies
My throat was an open grave i drank your stained glass eyes

And they taste like dead cathedrals
That are crumbling beneath a weight, ten thousand jaded tourists
Who've traded in their hearts and hands for
Disposable cameras, set to document to decay,
Set to capture just enough of life to catalogue the things we throw away.

(...Breathing the fumes of our machines...)
We've lost our way.
(...Breathing through television dreams...)

If we could only see us now.
If we could only see us now.

The words of the dead ring in our ears,
But its only a lie.
The voice in your head brings you to tears,
But you don't know why.
The words of the dead ring in our ears,
But its only a lie.
The voice in your head brings you to tears,
But its only a lie,
Yes, its only a lie,
...Isn't it?&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;True friends stab you in the front
Keep you from getting what you want
When one more fix could kill you
They help you realize that

You're more and less than you first had believed
You've so much to give and there's so much you need
Shortcuts through graveyards and a brand new way to breathe
Three thousand miles just to learn,

All that's gold does not all shine...
And helping words aren't always kind,
When one more kiss could kill you,
They help you realize that

You're more and less than you first had believed
You've so much to give and there's so much you need
Shortcuts through graveyards and a brand new way to breathe
Three thousand miles just to learn.

How to let my guard down
Accept the fire that has spread among us.
And if you're feeling all right,
You've got to play it again,
You've got to play it again.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;The air my lungs first loved
Carves craters from my eyes
They said &quot;breathe deeply son 
Or be the next to die&quot;

Beneath the falling night
And heaven's shutting gate
Pray keep your tongue held tight
Or suffer the same fate

The blood on our black gloves
It is none of your concern
If you want to call our bluff
Get in line and wait your turn
And watch the witches burn&quot;

Don't flinch when innocents
Are dancing with the flame
If they wanted to live
They'd learn to play the game

You can still walk away
If you just hold your tongue
If you'd just walk away
You'd live to see the sun but&quot;

Under this killing moon
Under this burning sky
The fire's shining groom
I hold my breath and close my eyes

&quot;The blood on our black gloves
It is none of your concern
If you want to call our bluff
Get in line and wait your turn
And watch the witches burn
We'll watch the witches burn&quot;&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;One day the dreamers died within us 
When all our answers never came 
We hid the truth beneath our skin but 
Our shadows never looked the same 

A ghost is all that's left 
Of everything we swore we never would forget 
We tried to bleed the sickness 
But we drained our hearts instead 
We are, we are the dead 

And when we couldn't stop the bleeding 
We held our hearts over the flame 
We couldn't help but call it treason 
After that we couldn't fill our frames 
After that our shadows never looked the same 

A ghost is all that's left 
Of everything we swore we never would forget 
We tried to bleed the sickness 
But we drained our hearts instead 
We are, we are the dead 

In summers past we'd challenge fate 
With higher pitch and perfect aim 
And standing fast, we'd radiate 
A light we loved but never named 
But the answers never came 
And our shadows never looked the same 

A ghost is all that's left (we are the ones who lost our faith)
Of everything we swore we never would forget (can we be saved?)
We tried to bleed the sickness 
But we drained our hearts instead 
We are, we are the dead (we are the ones who lost our faith)
A ghost of everything we thought but never said (can we be saved?)
We tried to bleed the sickness 
But we drained our hearts instead 

We are the ones who lost our faith 
We dug ourselves an early grave 
We are the dead, can we be saved?&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Your eyes, followed me here. 
Your eyes, seamless and sure. 
They leave me broken and, in need of a cure. 

Your eyes, followed me here. 
Your eyes, sifting my soul. 
They leave me broken and forge diamonds from the coal.

They race me along
the infinite synapse of white lines.
and then while chasing the dawn
with storybook syntax
Your eyes slit the throat, of all I know.
About myself in this life. 
This silhouette lie.

And your eyes, speaking in tongues. 
Vigilant still, filling my lungs. 
Testing my will. 
They leave me broken and, bruised and bleeding. 

Your eyes, resting in flame, 
Leave me breathless again
Like hydrogen
Split on fault lines
or ten years living with
exposure to radon

Your eyes slit the throat, of all I know. 
About myself in this life. 
This silhouette lie.

Your eyes, Your eyes. 
Speaking in tongues. 
Vigilant still, lead our way. 
Filling my lungs. 
Testing my will. 

You slit the throat, of all I know. 
About myself in this life. 
This silhouette lie.

You slit my throat. 
Because I know, 
That this life, is a lie. 
So slit my throat.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I sit here clutching useless lists
And keys for doors that don't exist
I crack my teeth on pearls
I tear into the history
Show me what it means to me in this world
Yeah in this world

'Cause I am due for a miracle
I'm waiting for a sign
I'll stare straight into the sun
And I won't close my eyes
Till I understand or go blind 

I see the parts but not the whole
I study saints and scholars both
No perfect plan unfurls
Do I trust my heart or just my mind
Why is truth so hard to find in this world
Yeah in this world

'Cause I am due for a miracle
I'm waiting for a sign
I'll stare straight into the sun
And I won't close my eyes
Till I understand or go blind (till I understand or go blind)

I know that there's a point I've missed
A shrine or stone I haven't kissed
A scar that never graced my wrist
A mirror that hasn't met my fist
But I can't help feeling like I'm

Due for a miracle
I'm waiting for a sign (waiting for a sign)
I'll stare straight into the sun
And I won't close my eyes (and I won't close my eyes)

Due for a miracle
I'm waiting for a sign
I'll stare straight into the sun
And I won't close my eyes&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;They preach to the choir, always in the permanent daylight
They toss paper tigers from their perfect porcelain skylines

Listen for the sound (for the sound, for the sound), 
As it all comes crashing down (as it all comes crashing down)
[x2]

They preach to the choir, always in the permanent daylight
They toss paper tigers from their perfect, shatterproof spires

They light the world on fire, just to watch it burn
It'll be their funeral pyre, but they never seem to learn
[x2]

Listen for the sound (for the sound, for the sound), 
As it all comes crashing down (as it all comes crashing down)
[x2]

And we paid the price, we paid for their crimes with our blood, 
with our blood, with our blood, with our blood
Paid with our blood and our lives, 
With our blood and our lives, 
With our blood and our lives 
With our blood and our lives, 
With our blood and our lives&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;The blue light spills like oceans
We smile and let it in
It cures us of our questions
Like hoods on peregrine

Knowledge locked in a tower
Barons will hold the key
But if knowledge is power,
Know this is tyranny
All we're asking for is what's ours

You think they're selling you truth,
Truth is, they're selling you out
The truth, they're selling you out

The black ink fuels our notions
That all the facts are in
It cures us of our questions
Like hoods on peregrine

Knowledge locked in a tower
Barons will hold the key
But if knowledge is power,
Know this is tyranny

All we're asking for is what's ours

You think they're selling you truth
But they're just selling you
And if we keep buying in
The line between lies and truth
Will wear paper thin,
Paper thin

You think they're selling you truth,
The truth is, they're selling you out&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I've waited for this moment
All my life and more
And now I see so clearly
What I could not see before.
The time is now or never
This chance won't come again
Throw caution and myself into the wind.

There's no promise of safety with these secondhand wings
But I'm willing to find out what impossible means.
A leap of faith.

Parody of an angel
Miles above the sea
I hear the voice of reason
Screaming after me
&quot;You've flown far too high boy now you're too close to the sun,
Soon your makeshift wings will come undone&quot;

But how will I know limits from lies if I never try?

There's no promise of safety with these secondhand wings
But I'm willing to find out what impossible means.
I'll climb through the heavens on feathers and dreams
'Cause the melting point of wax means nothing to me.
Nothing to me
Nothing to me

I will touch the sun or I will die trying.
Die Trying.

Fly on these secondhand wings
Willing to find out what impossible means
I'll climb through the heavens on feathers and dreams
'Cause the melting point of wax means nothing to me
Nothing to me
Means nothing to me
Miles above the sea.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Here's your new drug
Shoot it in the left eye
Feel it on the right side
No it's not love
Though it sets up shop behind your ribcage
Building blood clots and black holes
Like using an axe to pull
A sliver from your skin

And they say this is medicine
An overdose of oxygen
A severed head as sedative
To be at peace would be a sin
And surely un-american
I'm breaking

Here's your new blood
Transfusion took us all night
Tell us that you're all right
No it's not love
Though feels like fire inside of your veins
Burning right beneath the wrist
Begging for a razor's kiss
To free it from your skin

And they say this is medicine
An overdose of oxygen
A severed head as sedative
To be at peace would be a sin
And surely unamerican
I'm breaking down

Lift the veil, it's not medicine
And my heart fails, time and time again&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Late night, brakes lock, hear the tires squeal
Red light, can't stop so I spin the wheel
My world goes black before I feel an angel lift me up
And I open bloodshot eyes into fluorescent white
They flip the siren, hit the lights, close the doors and I am gone

Now I lay here owing my life to a stranger
And I realize that empty words are not enough
I'm left here with the question of just
What have I to show except the promises I never kept?
I lie here shaking on this bed, under the weight of my regrets

[Chorus:]
I hope that I will never let you down
I know that this can be more than just flashing lights and sound

Look around and you'll see that at times it feels like no one really cares
It gets me down but I'm still gonna try to do what's right, I know that there's
A difference between sleight of hand, and giving everything you have
There's a line drawn in the sand, I'm working up the will to cross it and

[Chorus]

Rhetoric can't raise the dead
I'm sick of always talking when there's no change
Rhetoric can't raise the dead
I'm sick of empty words, let's lead and not follow

Late night, brakes lock, hear the tires squeal
Red light, can't stop so I spin the wheel
My world goes black before I feel an angel steal me from the
Greedy jaws of death and chance, and pull me in with steady hands
They've given me a second chance, the artist in the ambulance

[Chorus]

Can we pick you off the ground, more than flashing lights and sound&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Wake up everyone! It's not too late
To save the remnants of our hearts,
So stop giving up our last shot at love,
Our only chance to find the meaning of
The beat beneath the blood

We laugh at honor and are shocked when
We find knives in our backs
We follow those who cheat and steal
Look in my eyes, you won't find your way back
Our only compass smashed under our own heels
Reason abandoned to appetites and addicts arms
Shotguns and silence have always been the best of charms

Wake up everyone! It's not too late
To save the remnants of our hearts,
So stop giving up our last shot at love,
Our only chance to find the meaning of
The beat beneath the blood

We laugh at honor and are shocked when
We find knives in our backs
We follow those who cheat and steal
Look in my eyes, you won't find your way back
Our only compass smashed under our own heels, under our iron will

The abolition of man is within the reach of science
But are we so far gone that we'll try it?&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Paint the target
We don't need no evidence
Flood the market
We do it all in self defense
You're a smart kid
Never work without your gloves
If you're a smart kid
You'll stay the hell away from love

And if it comes to murder
Don't tell and we won't ask you how
You sleep at night when the lights go out
And you're all alone
With all the ghosts of lesser humans
Whose lives you've spilt to suit your own

Sit and think of
All the dollars and the cents
And your blue blood
You'll see it all makes perfect sense
Drink from this cup
A better life awaits us all
You're one of us
Remember conscience comes before the fall

Your actions all are justified
Your actions all are justified

And if it comes to murder
Don't tell and we won't ask you how
You sleep at night when the lights go out
And you're all alone
With all the ghosts of lesser humans
Whose lives you've spilt to suit your own

Cause it's need to know
We are need to know
We don't need to know

Don't we all know life is sacred?
Don't we all know we bleed the same red blood?&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;We dream of ways to break these iron bars.
We dream of black nights without moon or stars.
We dream of tunnels and of sleeping guards.
We dream of blackouts in the prison yard.

Heartbroken, we found (a gleam of hope)
Harken to the sound, (a whistle blows)
Heaven sent reply, (however small)
Evidence of life (beyond these walls)
Born and bred (in this machine)
Wardens dread (to see us dream)
We hold tight (to legends of)
Real life, (the way it was before)

We dream of jailers throwing down their arms
We dream of open gates and no alarms

We dream of ways to break these iron bars
We dream of black nights without moon or stars
We dream of ways to break these iron bars
We dream of black nights without moon or stars
We dream of ways to break these iron bars
We dream of black nights without moon or stars

Heartbroken, we found (a gleam of hope)
Harken to the sound, (a whistle blows)
Heaven sent reply, (however small)
Evidence of life (beyond these walls)
Born and bred (in this machine)
Wardens dread (to see us dream)
We hold tight (to legends of)
Real life, (the way it was before)

Look to the day the Earth will shake
These weathered walls will fall away
Look to the day the Earth will shake
These weathered walls will fall away
Look to the day the Earth will shake
These weathered walls will fall away
Look to the day the Earth will shake
These weathered walls will fall away&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;It's been so long...long, and tin cans and string for years
Is all that we've known, could it be you're really here.

'Cause my eyes are open, and everything still moves in slow-motion,
Breathless and blue, and behind your eyes the sea
Oceans of light envelope me.

But things can't be as they seem, I'm so far from home
This must be another dream, but my eyes are open.

Everything still moves in slow-motion,
Breathless and blue, and behind your eyes the sea
Oceans of light envelope me

My eyes are open, everything still moves in slow-motion,
Breathless and blue, and behind your eyes the sea
Oceans of light envelope me&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I know one day, all our scars will disappear, like the stars at dawn
And all of our pain, will fade away when morning comes
And on that day we look backwards we will see, that everything is changed
All of our trials, will be as milestones on the way.

And as long as we live, every scar is a bridge to someone's broken heart
And there's no greater love, than that one shed his blood for his friends

On that day all of the scales will swing to set all the wrongs to right
All of our tears, all of our fears will take to flight
Until then all of our scars will still remain, we've learned that if we'll
Open the wounds, share them then soon they start to heal

As long as we live, we are bridges to someone's broken heart
There's no greater love, shed your blood for your friends

We must see that every scar is a bridge, as long as we live
We must open up these wounds
When someone stands in your shoes and will shed his own blood
There's no greater love. We must open up our own wounds.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;How can you be sleeping, waves like weapons crash
O'er us, cry for mercy and hold fast hope

Who of us is cursed, or do we have to ask
Search your souls and hold fast
If no one speaks a word, then let the lots be cast
Truth be told and hold fast

White death wakes in black skies, mark your maker's wrath
Fear and flames of azure climb the crooked mast
You will yet be baptized, steeped in shattered glass
Sink and sing your answer and hold fast

As strong arms grip your shoulders like dead hands of the past
Pray as you're tossed over, this breath could be your last

Quiet and cold, silent and slow
Night black as coal, miles here below

Find your faith and dive deep, through living gateways pass
Lined with death and ivory, and hold fast, hold fast

Deep beneath the black dawn, leagues from lightning's flash
Ribs will raise cathedrals for the morning mass
Steel yourself in sackcloth, roll your heart in ash
Scrape your skin with steel wool and hold fast hope
Ribs will raise cathedrals for the morning mass
Scrape your skin with steel wool
Cross your heart and hold fast hope...
hold fast hope...
hold fast hope...&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;We move for all mankind, a million miles from everything we've ever known
We're on their hearts and minds, a million heads are bowed to bring us safely home
Hemmed in by emptiness, a million ways that everything could be undone
This hollow in my chest is filled with reasons not to sing but I found one, I know

We are not alone, we feel an unseen love
We are sons and heirs of grace
We are children of a light that never dims
A love that never dies, keep your chin up child
And wipe the tears from your eyes

In sleep we saw ourselves, a million years we had been waiting there it seems
While someone weaves a spell, a million stars look on in witness to our dreams, I know

We are not alone, we feel an unseen love
We are sons and heirs of grace
We are children of a light that never dims
A love that never dies, keep your chin up child
And wipe the tears from your eyes

We feel an unseen love
We are children of light

We are not alone, we feel an unseen love
We are sons and heirs of grace
We are children of-light that never dims
A love that never dies, keep your chin up child
And wipe the tears from your eyes

Stand ready and tall, reflect the light&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Once again these bitter herbs
The perfect compliment to all your cryptic words
Nod but don't know what to say, I know you
I believe you're who you say you are so I?

I will follow you, lay down my life
I would die for you, this very night

Once again the bread and wine
But it seems the meanings may be deeper still this time
You surprised me when you said I'd fall away, don't you know me
I could never be ashamed of you, no I?

I will follow you, lay down my life
I would die for you, this very night

I've never been this cold, the fire's gravity compels
Like planets cling to sol, I feel my orbit start to fail
Like moths to flame I come, too close and all my oaths are burned
As stars begin to run, all my accusers take their turn
And calling curses down, from my lips lies like poison spill
And then that awful sound, the sound of prophesy fulfilled
And then I met your eyes, and I remember everything
And something in me dies, the night that I betrayed my king&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;The towers that shoulder your pride
The words you've written in stone
Sand will cover them, sand will cover you
The streets that suffer your name
Your very flesh and your bones
Sand will cover them, sand will cover you

So put your faith in more than steel
Don't store your treasures up, with moth and rust
Where thieves break in and steal
Pull the fangs from out your heel
We live in but a shadow of the real

Step out from time, see the dust of nations
Step out from time, hear the stars ovation

Saturn will not sleep, until the sand has made us clean
Still we stack our stones and bury what we can
But it all will be undone, and nothing built under the sun
Will ever stand before the endless march of sand

So put your faith in more than steel
Don't store your treasures up, with moth and rust
Where thieves break in and steal
Pull the fangs from out your heel
We live in but a shadow of the real

So put your faith in more than steel
Don't store your treasures up, with moth and rust
Where thieves break in and steal
Pull the fangs from out your heel
We live in but a shadow of the real&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Wake, stand and feel your worth, O my soul.
Kneel and know the word that can save us all.

We are fuel and fire both.
We are water.
Wed with wine and ghost.

We are wrought with breath and dirt, washed in second sight.
Woven through the earth, wreathed in rings of light.

Stand and feel your worth, O my soul.
Kneel and know the word, come to die.

We will wield a second birth, whet our wits and knives.
Wrap our knees in earth, wrap ourselves in light.

Wake, we will weigh and drink this cup.
We will burn, we will not burn up.

Wake, feel your worth, O my soul.
Speak the word, the word that can save us all.
Awed by grace, I fall on my face.
And scream the word that can save us all.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I know what lies beneath, I've seen the flash of teeth.
Conspiring with the reef to sink our ship.
The wind's a cheating wife, her tongue a thirsty knife.
And she could take your life with one good kiss.

Can you see the sky turn red?
As morning's light breaks over me,
Know tonight we'll make our bed
At the bottom of the sea.

I know the ocean speaks, I've heard her call to me.
And smiling in my dreams she whispers this
(The stars retreat behind their veil.
The clouds are clinging to your sail.
The storm is coming can you see?)

Can you see the sky turn red?
As morning's light breaks over me,
Know tonight we'll make our bed
At the bottom of the sea.

Look and see the sky turn red.
Like blood it covers over me.
And soon the sea shall give up her dead.
We'll raise an empire from the bottom of the sea&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Call everyone to arms
We'll fill the heavens 
With the poisoned dreams of man
Call everyone to arms
We forged these weapons 
With the strength of our own hands 

We shot the sun from the sky
Apollo dead at our feet
We wander lost in the rye
We gather round in the street

For centuries we watched the sky
And burned to bridge the great divide

Call everyone to arms
We'll fill the heavens 
With the poisoned dreams of man
Call everyone to arms
We built these weapons 
With our pride and with the strength of our own hands

Eclipse the body with stones
And lay him down with the rest
I smile when i am alone
And shed a tear for the press

For centuries we watched the sky
And burned to bridge the great divide 
Cause we dug the body up
We drank his golden blood
And light shone from our eyes
But it was not enough
'Cause we still dream of deicide

For centuries we watched the sky
We burned to bridge the great divide
But now we burn with power and pride&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;What a beautiful way to fake it
A sort of graceful defeat
We pound a pattern out on the pavement
We sound a siren out through the streets
Advance with perfect nonchalance
To the staccato of the rifle report
Don't marvel out our confidence
It's just bravado that a blindfold affords

You tell me that you wanna stop the war
But baby you can't dance if there's no floor
Motion isn't meaning, it's just another drug
But it's all we've got

What a way to keep it together
A black box, a prescription for speed
We found a freeway that goes on forever
We drown a demon in the deep black sea

Shield your eyes
Keep running to the rhythm of the rifle repeating
I'm paralyzed 
But I gotta keep moving if I want to keep breathing

You tell me that you wanna stop the war
But baby you can't dance if there's no floor
Motion isn't meaning, it's just another drug
But it's all we've got... we've got nowhere to go

I'll take the knife or the easy chair
We are but gods for a moment
I'll take the knife or the easy chair
We are but gods&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Ah, look at all the lonely people.
Ah, look at all the lonely people.
Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been,
Lives in a dream.
Sits by the window, wearing a face that she keeps in a jar by the door,
Who is it for?
All the lonely people, where do they all belong?
All the lonely people, where do they all come from?
Father McKenzie, writing the words of a sermon that no-one will hear,
No-one comes near
Look at him working, darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there,
What does he care?
All the lonely people, where do they all belong?
All the lonely people, where do they all come from?
Ah, look at all the lonely people.
Ah, look at all the lonely people.
Ah, look at all the lonely people.
Ah, look at all the lonely people.
Eleanor Rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name.
Nobody came.
Father McKenzie, wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave.
No-one was saved.
All the lonely people, where do they all belong?
All the lonely people, where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
All the lonely people
All the lonely people, where do they all come from?&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Do you believe in heaven above
Do you believe in love
Don't tell me a lie
Don't be false or untrue
It all comes back to you

Open fire on my burning heart
I've never been lucky in love
My defences are down
A kiss or a frown
I can't survive on my own

If a girl walks in
And carves her name in my heart
I'll turn and run away
Everyday we've all been led astray
It's hard to be lucky in love

It get's in your eyes
It's making you cry
Don't know what to do
Don't know what to do
Looking for love
Calling heaven above

Send me an angel
Right now

Empty dreams can only disappoint
In a room behind your smile
But don't give up, don't give up
You can be lucky in love&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Oh, that I could scream
And the world would stop and listen
And these scars could speak in volumes
But who has ears to hear
Or eyes to see
Again I scream
But my voice is buried in an unearthly silence
Like in nightmares when ghosts steal your breath.
I pray that power be not in my words
But in truth that supercedes the mind of man
And our dead hope, and our blind faith in means that look to justify the ends.
I feel a presence in the room
I feel cold fingers close around my neck.
With out you I am lost.
Let my eyes not fail with looking upward&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;
We sail through endless skies
Stars shine like eyes
The black night sighs
The moon in silver trees
Falls down in tears
Light of the night
The earth, a purple blaze
Of sapphire haze
In orbit always

While down below the trees
Bathed in cool breeze
Silver starlight breaks down the night
And so we pass on by the crimson eye
Of great god Mars
As we travel the universe
&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;
Reflex in the sky warn you you're gonna die
Storm coming, you'd better hide from the atomic tide
Flashes in the sky turns houses into sties
Turns people into clay, radiation minds decay

Robot minds of robot slaves lead them to atomic rage
Plastic flowers, melting sun, fading moon falls upon
Dying world of radiation, victims of man's frustration
Burning globe of oxy'n fire, like electric funeral pyre

Buildings crashing down to a cracking ground
Rivers turn to wood, ice melting to flood
Earth lies in death bed, clouds cry water dead
Tearing life away, here's the burning pay

Electric Funeral
Electric Funeral
Electric Funeral
Electric Funeral

And so in the sky shines the electric eye
supernatural king takes earth under his wing
Heaven's golden chorus sings, Hell's angels flap their wings
Evil souls fall to Hell, ever trapped in burning cells!
&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Here she comes again
She's feeling like she's already won
I believe it's gonna end again, all for naught
My philosophy is things are just as wrong as they seem
I believe it's gonna end this way, atrocity
Do you believe in love
Like I believe in pain
Nobody died for you, somebody pray for me

When you see me cut me down
And I will force it underground
There's no one left to hurt but me
And it's because of me, right?

There he walks away
He's feeling like he's having them on
I believe he's gonna bend again
And all for naught
My philosophy is things are just as wrong as they seem
I've gotta get you off of me, it's such an oddity
Do you believe in love
Like I believe in pain
Nobody died for you
Somebody pray for me
I want to see you suffer
Suffer&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Hold me now I need to feel relief
Like I never wanted anything
I suppose I'll let this go and find a reason I'll hold on to
I'm so ashamed of defeat
And I'm out of reason to believe in me
I'm out of trying to get by

I'm so afraid of the gift you give me
I don't belong here and I'm not well
I'm so ashamed of the lie I'm living
Right on the wrong side of it all

I can't face myself when I wake up
And look inside a mirror
I'm so ashamed of that thing
I suppose I'll let it go
Untill I have something more to say for me
I'm so afraid of defeat
And I'm out of reason to believe in me
I'm out of trying to defy

I'm so afraid of the gift you give me
I don't belong here and I'm not well
I'm so ashamed of the lie I'm living
Right on the wrong side of it all

Hold me now I need to feel complete
Like I matter to the one I need

I'm so afraid of the gift you give me
I don't belong here and I'm not well
I'm so ashamed of the lie I'm living
Right on the wrong side of it all

Now I'm ashamed of this
I am so ashamed of this
Now I'm so ashamed of me
I am so ashamed of me...&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Try to hide myself
Give this to someone else
My hands are stained with scum
Wish I could wash it away
You keep taking, taking away
And keep breaking, breaking, break

I can't believe in yesterday
I feel you coming in
I can't just stand by and watch you
Save yourself as you fall from grace
When you come around, I won't be your sympathy

The worst is over now
You said it anyhow
My life in monochrome
Wish I could regain control
You keep taking, taking away
I keep faking, faking, fake

Find me, feel me fill me, then cut me up again
Find me, feel me the cut me up

HATE
ME
HATE&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Trust all the things
I tell you are true
Dress up in your best
So I can be proud of you
And never believe I won't turn on you
And never believe I do this for you...

You're leading me on again
And I find it yeah I like it
And I'm reeling in awe for sure
Now I know it was given to me
Given to me, given to me...

How I wish I could be rid of the ennui
Make you regret and make you afraid of me
And never believe I do this for me
And never believe I'll do this gently
Can't believe in broken promises
And render conscious all of me
I'll tell you it's all for you
Then deny it&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Will I fall again into dismay?
Will I be ashamed of crying?
And I know it's never been the way that I described
But I am afraid of trying
She's the one who keeps me all excited
She keeps me begging for more
She's the one who deems me uninvited
Now it's over

Never leave me, and don't deceive me
I'll keep on crawling my friend
Never tease me and don't leave me here
It's all the same in the end

Now I find that I am weaker fare
That I am ashamed of lying
And I know things never feel the way that's right inside
And I am afraid of dying
'Cause you're the one who keeps me all excited
You keep me begging for more
You're the one who keeps me uninvited
Now it's over
Never leave me, and don't deceive me
I'll keep on crawling my friend
It's only a symbol you're got me falling away
And I am afraid
Take back what I said
It's all the same in the end
It's all the same in the end
It's all the same in the end
It's only a symbol&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Must be something they're hiding
Must be reasons that no one will dare to tell
Must be something inside me
But I don't think so anymore
It's hurting again now
And I don't need friends when I have foes like you
It's hurting again now
It's killing me to be here all alone
Go away it's all the same
There's more for me

As the world falls away, and I can't find a reason
As the world turns to grey
It's killing me unwillingly and I am just the same as you

Must be something confided
Must be someway to feel the pain and heal again
Pain and pleasure, inviting
I don't think so anymore
It's hurting again now
And I don't need pills
When I have drugs like you
It's hurting again now
It's killing me to be here all alone
Go away
It's all the same
There's more for me
I'm just like you, just not a fool
I'm just like you
Shut up...&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Well the tongue inside my mouth is not for sale
Any spirit left in me is fading fast
Could you throw another stone to ease my pain?
Could you throw another stone to seal my fate?
'Cause I didn't believe in this world anymore, anymore
I don't believe in me

And if I can rise above this I'll be saved
Can anybody save me?
And if I can die for love, then I'm enslaved
Can anybody save me?

Second chances are too few and far between
Will to change this circumstance eludes me still
Should I grow another shell in which to live?
Should I grow another shell and not forgive?
'Cause I don't believe in this world anymore, anymore
I don't believe in me
Goodbye cruel world
Goodbye cruel world
Goodbye cruel world at last you see me drown
Goodbye cruel world&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Here she's coming and she's drunk again
She's only seventeen
Her daddy said &quot;well that's enough of that come be my little queen&quot;
And now he's touching her wrong again
He's gonna give her disease
He never wanted it anyway
He only does as he please

Won't you tell her that I said I'm the one
I couldn't hurt her like everyone
And tell her that I said I'm the one
And I don't deserve her

Here he's coming and he's drunk again
He's on amphetamines
Scratch his nails down the other leg
'Cause you're my little queen
And now he's touching her wrong again
She's only trying to get by
He never wanted it anyway
He never soils the child

Won't you tell her that I said I'm the one
I couldn't hurt her like everyone
And tell her that I said I'm the one
And I don't deserve her
We're coming for you
You&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Watch it blow my mind
It's something I am ill-prepared to remedy
But let it slow the time
It takes to die and close your eyes to your enemy
Defy!
Self-made millionaires won't take ideas
From all the little plebeians just suffocate with smiles
And force fed lies
And close your mind to reality
Deny

It feels like I'm losing again
When I've lost everything
I'm sure I will see more clearly
Lose what I'm feeling to them
And not feeling anything
I'm sure I will bleed sincerely
Tonight!

So you make the simplest mistake
So you make the simplest mistake
And fearlessly you deny your involvement in my demise
But give me your open hand&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Leave your mark under my skin
Oh my how strong you are
And feast your eyes on my disdain
And hope this one won't scar

I will never belong to you, again
I will never belong to you,
Push if you still need my pain
Cause I will never tell
And scream if you still hate my name
Cause I'll be where I fell

Come sit close to me,
Let me feel your breath
Come sit close to me
Hands around my neck
Come sit close to me,
Let me feel your breath
Come sit close to me, close to me, yeah

I will never belong to you, again
I will never belong to you

If I decide that I am alive
Than I'm diseased and ungrateful
And if I confide that I am a liar
Than I'm diseased and ungrateful
Push in 'til it breaks, if it bleeds then I'll be okay

Than I am alive and I'm diseased and ungrateful
If I decide that I am alive
Than I'm diseased and ungrateful
If I confide that I am a liar
Than I am alive and I'm diseased and ungrateful

Come sit close to me
Come sit close to me
Come sit close to me
Come sit close to me&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I am a plastic man, wish I can be the one you could be proud of.
I'm losin' heart again, wish I could show you what you think I'm made of.
Someday I know I'll find my place, someday I know this pain will fade.

I am a perfect sell, just wrap me up with a bow and flowers.
I will neglect to tell, I'll sell your story that we love each other. 
Someday I know I'll find my place, someday I know this pain will fade.
Someday I know I'll find my place, someday I'll sing my last refrain.

Why don't let me be, and I'll pretend I'm well.
Cuz you're blind to see, and I'm too tired to tell.
And in your apathy, your head begins to swell.
Another tradegy, but you're too cold to feel.

Someday I know I'll find my place, someday I know this pain will fade.
Someday I know I'll find my place, someday I'll sing my last refrain&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I'm gonna be a rock &amp; roll star
Gotta groove from night to day
Gotta blow my honey jar
Gonna blow my blues away

I'm gonna make a stand
Gonna make a million
Gonna make it with you
I'm gonna be right my friend
I'm gotta push it through

It's electric
It's electric
It's electric
It's electric

I stop on red but leave on amber
And you face my way
I'm gonna make it my friend
Gonna make it today
Gonna get this dust from my hills
Down the highway I go
Gonna get the stars from my ?route?
Make it in a rock and roll show

It's electric
It's electric
It's electric
It's electric

I stop on red but leave on amber
And you face my way
I'm gonna make it my friend
Gonna make it today
Gonna get the dust from my hills
Down the highway I go
Gonna get the stars from my ?route?
Make it in a rock and roll show

It's electric
It's electric
It's electric
It's electric
It's electric
It's electric
It's electric
It's electric&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Feel so good I feel so fine
Love that little lady always on my mind
She gives me lovin' every night and day
Never gonna leave her
Never going away

Someone to love me
You know she makes me feel alright
Someone to need me
Love me every single night

Feel so happy since I met that girl
When we're making love, It's something out of this world
Feels so good to know that she's all mine
Going to love that woman 'till the end of time

Someone to live for
Love me 'till the end of time
She makes me feel happy
It's good to know that she's all mine


I am the world that hides
The universe of secret obtains
Destruction of the empty spaces
Here's my one and only prayer
I lived a thousand times
I found out what it means to be believed
The thoughts and images
The unborn child that never was conceived
You gotta believe me!
Hey! I'm talkin' to you!
Well, I know it’s hard for you
To know the reason why
And I know you'll understand
When it's time to die
I don't believe the knife you have 
Will be the only one
You have to let your body sleep
To let your soul live on, Ha Ha!!

Feel so happy since I met that girl
When we're making love, it's something out of this world
Feel so good to know that she's all mine
Gonna love that woman till the end of time

Someone to live for, love me till the end of time!
She makes me feel happy, it's good to know she's all mine,
She's all mine, yeah!&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;On a long and lonesome highway, east of Omaha
You can listen to the engine's
moanin' out it's one old song
You can think about the woman or the girl
You knew the night before

But your thoughts will soon be wandering
The way they always do
When you're ridin' sixteen hours
And there's nothin' much to do
And you don't feel much like ridin'
You just wish the trip was through

Chorus:
Here I am, On the road again
There I am, Up on the stage
There I go, Playin' star again
There I go, Turn the page

So you walk into this restaurant
Strung out from the road
And you feel the eyes upon you
As you're shakin' off the cold
You pretend it doesn't bother you
But you just want to explode

Yeah, most times you can't hear 'em talk
But other times you can
All the same old cliché's:
&quot;Is it woman? Is it man?&quot;
And you always seem outnumbered
You don't dare make a stand
Make your stand

Chorus:
Here I am, On the road again
There I am, Up on the stage
Here I go, Playn' star again
There I go, Turn the page

Whoa-oh
Out there in the spotlight, you're a million miles away
Every ounce of energy, you try and give away
As the sweat pours out your body, like the music that you play

Later in the evenin' as you lie awake in bed
With the echoes of the amplifiers ringin' in your head
You smoke the day's last cigarette
Rememberin' what she said
What she said

(Yeah, what she said.)

Yeah
Here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
Here I go, playn' star again
There I go, turn the page
And there I go, turn that page
There I go, yeah
Here I go, yeah(3x)
There I go, there I go
(And I'm gone)&lt;/lyrics&gt;

Don't utter a single word

Just shut your pretty mouth

I'll be seeing you again
I'll be seeing you in Hell

Don't cry to me oh baby
Your future's in an oblong box, yeah
Don't cry to me oh baby
Should have seen it a-comin' on
Don't cry to me oh baby
I don't know it was in your power
Don't cry to me oh baby
Dead-end girl for a dead-end guy
Don't cry to me oh baby
Now your life drains on the floor
Don't cry to me oh baby

Die, die, die my darling
Don't utter a single word
Die, die, die my darling
Just shut your pretty mouth

I'll be seeing you again
I'll be seeing you in Hell

Don't cry to me a baby
Your future is in an oblong box
Don't cry to me oh baby
Should have seen the end a-comin' on, a-comin'
Don't cry to me oh baby
I don't know it was in your power

&lt;lyrics&gt;There's a devil waiting outside your door
(How much longer)
There's a devil waiting outside your door
(How much longer)
And he's bucking and braying and pawing at the floor
(How much longer)
And he's howling with pain and crawling up the walls
(How much longer)
There's a devil waiting outside your door
(How much longer)
He's weak with evil and broken by the world
(How much longer)
He's shouting your name and he's asking for more
(How much longer)
There's a devil waiting outside your door
(How much longer)

Loverman! Since the world began
Forever, Amen, Till end of time
Take off that dress , ooh I'm coming down yeah

Cause I am what I am what I am what I am

L is for LOVE, baby
O is for ONLY you that I do
V is for loving VIRTUALLY all that you are
E is for loving almost EVERYTHING that you do
R is for RAPE me
M is for MURDER me
A is for ANSWERING all of my prayers
N is for KNOWING your loverman's going to

Loverman! Till the bitter end
While the empires burn down
Forever and ever and ever and ever Amen
I'm your loverman
So help me, baby So help me baby
Cause I am what I am what I am what I am
I'm your loverman!

There's a devil crawling along your floor
(How much longer) etc...for the rest
There's a devil crawling along your floor
With a trembling heart, he's coming through your door
With his straining sex in his jumping paw
There's a devil crawling along your floor
And he's old and he's stupid and
he's hungry and he's sore
And he's blind and he's lame
and he's dirty and he's poor
Give him (or me?) more
There's a devil crawling along your floor

Loverman! Here I stand! Forever, Amen
Cause I am what I am what I am what I am
Forgive me, babyyyy! My hands are tied
And I got no choice No, I got no choice, no choice at all

To take off your dress And be your man, be your man
Seize the throne, Seize the mantle
Seize the crown, Cause I am what I am
What I am what I am I'm your loverman!

There's a devil lying by your side
(How much longer)
There's a devil lying by your side
(How much longer)
You might think he's asleep
but take a look at his eyes
And wants you, darling, to be his bride
There's a devil lying by your side

Loverman! Loverman!&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;They're walking by the night
The moon has frozen blue
Long black coats a shelter for the rain
Their load must get through
Now bats are leaving their trees
They're joining the call
Seven satanic Hell preachers
Heading for the hall

Bringing the blood of a newborn child, yeahhhh
Got to succeed, if not it's Satan's fall


(Curse Of The Pharaohs)

Away out in Egypt in the valley of kings
Where the mummified pharaohs
Pretend dead in their sleep, yeah

Don't touch, never ever steal
Unless you're in for the kill

Or you'll be hit by the curse of the pharaohs
Yes you'll be hit and the curse is on you, hit me 

The curse of the pharaohs can be so deadly
Just destroying your future
Makin' it all shady

Don't touch, never ever steal
Unless you're in for the kill

Or you'll be hit by the curse of the pharaohs
Yes you'll be hit and the curse is on you 


(A Corpse Without Soul)

Listen,
I'm a corpse, I'm a corpse, I'm a corpse without soul
Satan,
He's taken, he's taken, He's taken his toll
And he took it on me

I,
I'm trapped, I'm trapped, I'm trapped in his spell
Tonight,
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going to Hell, inside his spell


(Into The Coven)

Howl like a wolf
And a witch will open the door
Follow me and meet our high priestess

Yeahhhh, come, come, into my coven
Yeahhhh, and become, Lucifer's child

Undress until you're naked
And put on this white coat
Take this white cross, and go to the centre of the ring

Yeahhh, come, come into my coven
Yeahhh, and become Lucifer's child


(Evil)

I was born on the cemetery
Under the sign of the moon
Raised from my grave by the dead
And I was made a mercenary
In the legions of Hell
Now I'm king of pain, I'm insane

You know, my only pleasure
Is to hear you cry
I'd love to hear you cry
I'd love to see you die

And I'll be the first
To watch your funeral
And I'll be the last to leave
I'd love to hear you cry

And when you're down beyond the ground
I'll dig up your body again
And make love to shame
Oh lady cry, and say goodbye
Oh lady cry, and say goodbye
You've gotta say goodbye
'Cause I will eat your mind&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Clock strikes twelve and moondrops burst
Out at you from their hiding place
Like acid and oil on a madman's face
His reasons tend to fly away
Like lesser birds on the four winds , yeah
Like silver scrapes in May
Now the sands become a crust
And most of you have gone away

Come Susie dear, let's take a walk
Just out there upon the beach
I know you'll soon be married
And you'll want to know where winds come from
Well it's never said at all
On the map that Carrie reads
Behind the clock back there you know
At the Four Winds Bar

Hey - hey hey!
Hey - hey hey!
Hey - hey hey!
Hey - hey hey!

Four winds at the Four Winds Bar
Two doors locked and windows barred
One door's let to take you in
The other one just mirrors it

Hey - hey hey!
Hey - hey hey!
Hey - hey hey!
Hey - hey hey!

Hellish glare and inference
The other one's a duplicate
The Queenly flux, eternal light
Or the light that never warms
Yes the light that never, never warms
Yes the light that never, never warms, never warms, never warms, never warms

The clock strikes twelve and moondrops burst
Out at you from their hiding place
Miss Carrie Nurse and Susie dear
Would find themselves at Four Winds Bar

It's the nexus of the crisis
And the origin of storms
Just the place to hopelessly
Encounter time and then came me

Hey - hey hey!
Hey - hey hey!
Hey - hey hey!
Hey - hey hey!

Call me Desdinova
Eternal light
These gravely digs of mine
Will surely prove a sight
And don't forget my dog
Fixed and consequent

Astronomy - a star
Astronomy - a star
Astronomy - a star
Astronomy - a star&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;As I was goin' over the Cork and Kerry mountains
I saw Captain Farrell and his money he was countin'
I first produced my pistol and then produced my rapier
I said &quot;stand and deliver or the devil he may take you&quot;

I took all of his money and it was a pretty penny
I took all of his money and I brought it home to Molly
She swore that she loved me, no never would she leave me
For the devil take that woman for you know she tricked me easy

Mush-a rain dum a doo dum a da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o

Being drunk and weary I went to Molly's chamber
Takin' my Molly with me but I never knew the danger
For about six or maybe seven in walked Captain Farrell
I jumped up, fired off my pistols and I shot him with both barrels

Mush-a rain dum a doo dum a da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o

Yeah, yeah whiskey!

Now some men like the fishin' and some men like the fowlin'
And some men like ta hear, ta hear a cannon ball a roarin'
Me I like sleepin', 'specially in my Molly's chamber
But here I am in prison, here I am with a ball and chain yeah

Mush-a rain dum a doo dum a da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o

Whiskey in the jar-o
Mush-a rain dum a doo dum a da
Mush-a rain dum a doo dum a da, hey
Mush-a rain dum a doo dum a da
Mush-a rain dum a doo dum a da, heyyy&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Train roll on, on down the line
Won't you please take me far, far away
Now, I feel the wind blow outside my door
I'm leaving my woman at home
My baby's gone

Tuesday's gone with the wind
My baby's gone, gone with the wind
(Long gone)

And I don't know where I'm going
I just want to be left alone
When this train ends, I'll try again
I'm leaving my woman at home
My baby's gone

Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone, long gone, with the wind
Tuesday's gone, gone, with the wind
My baby's gone with the wind

Train roll on, Tuesday's gone

Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone, long gone, with the wind
Tuesday's gone, long gone, with the wind
My baby's gone with the wind
Train rolls on

Train roll on, many miles from my home
See, I'm riding my blues baby, blues away
Tuesday, you see, she had to be free
But somehow, I've got to carry on
My baby's gone

Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone, long gone, with the wind (Tuesday's gone )
Tuesday's gone with the wind
My baby's gone with the wind
Train roll on
Train roll on
Ride on train
Ride on train
Ride on train

Train roll on
Train roll on
Train it rolls on
etc...
(fade)&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I've gotta see you moving fast, see you come my way.
See the dreams, I hope they last, never fade away.
Gotta see the lights above, make it loud tonight.
Gotta set it all afire, set it all alight.

See the flashing lights, hear the thunder roar,
I am gonna set you all alight.
Gotta make it man, I ain't got a choice,
Gotta fill this hall tonight.

Helpless, helpless, helpless, helpless.

I don't know what I'm gonna do, maybe not tonight.
Gotta set you all afire, gotta treat you right.
I can see the flashing lights, lit before your love.
Gotta hear the thunder roar, coming from above.

See the flashing lights, hear the thunder roar,
I am gonna set you all alight.
Gotta make it man, I ain't got a choice,
Gotta fill this hall tonight.

Helpless, helpless, helpless, helpless.

I can see the stars, I can see what's going on.
Every night alone I sing my song just for fun.
Only time will tell if I'll make it myself someday.
This stage is mine, music is my destiny.

Cannot squeeze the life from me.

I can see the stars, I can see what's going on.
Every night alone I sing my song just for fun.
Only time will tell if I'll make it myself someday.

&lt;lyrics&gt;Look out at the darkness, and you will see.
Just call my name and I'll be there.
You cannot touch me, you would not dare.
I am the chill that's in the air.

And I try to get through to you, in my own special way,
As the barriers crumble at the end of the day.

Dark rivers are flowing back into the past.
You are the fish for which I cast.
And what of the future, what is to be.
As the rivers flow into the sea.

And I try to get through to you, in my own special way,
As the barriers crumble at the end of the day.

Do not take for granted, powers out there.
Don't step into the demon's lair.
Time is an illusion, rising from time.
Steep is the mountain which we climb.

And I try to get through to you, in my own special way,
As the barriers crumble at the end of the day&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Motives changing, day to day,
The fire increases, masks decay.
I look at the river, white foam floats down,
The body's poisoned, gotta sit tight.

The wait, the wait, the wait, the wait.

After wakening, silence grows,
The screams subside, distortion shows.
Mutant thoughts of bad mouthed news,
Is just another birth of distorted views.

The wait, the wait, the wait, the wait.

The wait, the wait, the wait, the wait.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Look inside and you will see,
The words are cutting deep inside my brain.
Thunder burning, quickly burning,
Knife of words is driving me insane, insane yeah.

Raven black is on my track,
He shows me how to neutralize the knife.
Show to me in surgery,
The art of fighting words to conquer life, conquer life yeah.

Now the wicked lance of fear,
Is driving from my heady mountain brain.
Crash course in brain surgery,
Has stopped the bloody knife of words again yeah, yeah, yeah&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I got something to say, I killed your baby today and it
Doesn't matter much to me, as long as it's dead.
I got something to say, I raped your mother today and it
Doesn't matter much to me, as long as she's spread.

Ooh lovely dead, just waiting for your breath,
Cold sweet death, one last caress.

Ooh lovely dead, just waiting for your breath,
Cold sweet death, one last caress.

I got something to say, I killed your baby today and it
Doesn't matter much to me, as long as it's dead.

Ooh lovely dead, just waiting for your breath,
Cold sweet death, one last caress.
Last caress today, yo-o-o-oh, yooo-oh.

Here in this place lies the key to your death,
Touch it, see it.
Here in this place is the means to your end,
Touch it, feel it, green hell.

You did your best as someone could,
I bet you never knew you would,
And did you run away from me,
I bet you thought you really could.

We're gonna burn in hell - Green hell.
Like every hell but kind of green - Green hell, green hell.
Try let me get back up there - Green hell, green hell.
Feel it burning in your cereal - Green hell, greem hell.
Throw your fuckin' friends inside - Green hell, green hell.
Gotta fuckin' pay and you must stay - Green hell.
Cannot refill the torch of death - Green hell, green hell.
Hell is reigning in your blood - Green hell, green hell.
Gotta burn it all, green hell.

You did your best as someone could,
I bet you never knew you would,
And did you run away from me,
I bet you thought you really could.

Here in this place lies the key to your death,
Touch it, see it.
Here in this place is your world that ended,
Touch it, feel it, green hell.

You did your best as someone could,
I bet you never knew you would,
And did you run away from me,
I bet you thought you really could.
You've come to this as someone told,
I bet you never knew you would.
Gonna bring green hell, green hell.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;My mother was a witch, she was burned alive.
Nameless little bitch, ohh the tears I cried.
Take her down now, don't want to see her face
All blistered and burnt, can't hide my disgrace.

Twenty-seven, everyone was nice.
Gotta see 'em make 'em pay the price.
See their bodies out on the ice.
Take my time.

Am I evil?
Yes I am.
Am I evil?
I am man, yes I am.

As I watched my mother die, I lost my head.
Revenge now I sought, to break with my bread.
Taking no chances, you come with me.
I'll split you to the bone, help set you free.

Twenty-seven, everyone was nice.
Gotta see 'em make 'em pay the price.
See their bodies out on the ice.
Take my time.

Am I evil?
Yes I am.
Am I evil?
I am man, yes I am.

On with the action now, I'll strip your pride.
I'll spread your blood around, I'll see you rithe.
Your face is scarred with steel, wounds deep and neat.
Like a devil dancin' before ya, smells so sweet.

Am I evil?
Yes I am.
Am I evil?
I am man, yes I am.

I'll make my residence, I'll watch your fire.
You can come with me, sweet desire.
My face is long forgot, my face not my own.
Sweet and timely whore, take me home.

Am I evil?
Yes I am.
Am I evil?
I am man, yes I am.

My soul is longing for, await my heir.
Sent to avenge my mother, sweep myself.
My face is long forgot, my face not my own.
Sweet and timely whore, take me home.

Am I evil?
Yes I am.
Am I evil?
I am man, yes I am.

Am I evil?
Yes I fucking am.
Am I evil?
I am man, yeah&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Let us have peace, let us have life,
Let us escape the cruel night.
Let us have time, let the sun shine,
Let us beware the deadly sign.

The day is coming, armageddon's near,
Inferno's coming, can we survive the blitzkrieg.
The blitzkrieg, the blitzkrieg.

Save us from fate, save us from hate,
Save ourselves before it's too late.
Come to our need, hear our plea,
Save ourselves before the earth bleeds.

The day is dawning, the time is near,
Aliens calling, can we survive the blitzkrieg&lt;/lyrics&gt;

Open up your mind
Open up your purse
Open up your bones
Never, never gonna lose it

Take it all away
Never give an inch
Gotta make a mint
Gotta make me a million

Breadfan
You got it wrong
Some long time
friend's gonna lose it
In the end who's a fool

Seagull
Give it all away
Stay a bird
Stay a man
Stay a ghost
Stay what you wanna be

Loser
Give it all away
Never stay with the winner
With the man
With all the filthy money

Come on
Keep it on the side
With a ride
On a record on the top
If you're gonna be a bad boy

Breadfan
You got it wrong
Some long time friend's gonna lose it
In the end who's a fool

Seagull
Give it all away
Stay a bird
Stay a man
Stay a ghost
Stay what you wanna be

Open up your mind
Open up your purse
Open up your bones
Never, never gonna lose it

Breadfan
Take it all away
Never give an inch
Gotta make a mint
Gotta make me a million

Stay a ghost
Stay what you wanna be&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Now I see his face, I see his smile.
Such a lonely place, no golden mile.
Eyes tell of morbid tales, of his black heart.
His deeds through ages past tell of his part.

See his face, see his smile.
Time to die, yo-oh, wo-oh, no-oh.

Angel from below, change my dreams.
I want for glory's hour, for wealth's esteem.
I wish to sell my soul, to be reborn.
I wish for earthly riches, don't want no crown of thorns.

See his face, see his smile.
Time to die, wo-oh, o-oh, no-oh.

I was born a fool, don't want to stay that way.
Devil take my soul, with diamonds you repay.
I don't care for heaven, so don't you look for me to cry.
And I will burn in hell, from the day I die.

See his face, see his smile.
Time to die, o-oh, no-oh, no&lt;/lyrics&gt;

I was dreaming I was Al Capone.
Rumours going round, gotta clear out of town,
Smell like a dry fishbone.
Here come the law, gonna break down the door,
Carry me away once more.
Never, never, never want it anymore,
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor.
Crazy, stone cold crazy, you know.

Rainy afternoon, ought to kill a typhoon,
And she's playing on my slide trombone.
Anymore, anymore, cannot take it anymore,
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor.
Crazy, stone cold crazy, you know.

Walking down the street, shooting people that I meet,
Fully loaded Tommy gun.
Here come the deputy, try fucking getting me,
Gotta fucking get up and run.
They got the sirens loose, I ran right out of juice.
They're gonna put me in a cell,
If I can't go to heaven, let me go to hell.
Crazy, stone cold crazy, you know, yeah.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;So fucking what!

Well, I've been to Hastings and I've been to Brighton,
I've been to Eastbourne too.
So what, so what.
And I've been here, I've been there,
I've been every fucking where.
So what, so what.
So what, so what, you boring little cunt.

Well, who cares, who cares what you do.
Yeah, who cares, who cares about you, you, you, you, you.

Well, I fucked a queen, I fucked Bach,
I've even sucked an old man's cock.
So what, so what.
And I fucked a sheep, I fucked a goat,
I rammed my cock right down its throat.
So what, so what.
So what, so what, you boring little fuck.

Well, who cares, who cares what you do.
And, who cares, who cares about you, you, you, you, you.

And I've drunk that, I've drunk this,
I've spewed up on a pint of piss.
So what, so what.
I've had scank, I've had speed,
I've jacked up until I bleed.
So what, so what.
So what, so what, you boring little cunt.

Well, who cares, who cares what you do.
Yeah, who cares, who cares about you, you, you, you, you, you.

I've had crabs, I've had lice,
I've had the clap and that ain't nice.
So what, so what.
I fucked this, I fucked that,
I've even fucked a school girl's twat.
So what, so what.
So what, so what, you boring little fuck.

Well, who cares, who cares what you do.
And, who cares, who cares about you, you, you, you, you, you.

So fucking what! Yeah!&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Sound of gunfire comes through the night,
Killing and hatred, it's a terrible sight.
Reports come in of the heavy attack,
Message is seen, we're moving back.

Preparations are made for the journey back,
It's a survival, supplies are packed.
No more nights in this eternal hell,
Destination is simple, we move out.

Killing time - You left from the line.
Killing time - Your turn to kill.
Killing time - What do you say?
Killing time - Aaha, killing time.

And he knew what he needed to keep us alive,
No time for cowardice, kill and survive.
Like a killer kid with a switchblade knife,
Nasty word, he'll take your life.

The silence is over, they attack again,
Killing and hatred drive me insane.
Reports come in of a heavy attack,
Message is seen, we're moving back.

Killing time - You left from the line.
Killing time - Your turn to kill.
Killing time - What do you say?
Killing time - Aaha, killing time.

Sound of gunfire comes through the night,
Killing and hatred, it's a terrible sight.
Reports come in of a heavy attack,
Message is seen, we're moving back.

And he knew what he needed to keep us alive,
No time for cowardice, kill and survive.
Like a killer kid with a switchblade knife,
Nasty word, he'll take your life.

Killing time - You left from the line.
Killing time - Your turn to kill.
Killing time - What do you say?
Killing time - Aaha, killing time.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Only way to feel the noise
Is when it's good and loud
So good I can't believe it
Screamin' with the crowd

Don't sweat it
Give it back to you
Don't sweat it
Give it back to you
Overkill
Overkill
Overkill
Shut up

On your feet you feel the beat
It goes straight to your spine
Shake your head, you must be dead
If it don't make you fly

Don't sweat it
Give it back to you
Don't sweat it
Give it back to you
Overkill
Overkill
Overkill
Get the fuck down

Ooh yeah

Know your body's made to move
It goes straight to your spine
You gotta move it
If it don't make you fly

Don't sweat it
Give it back to you
Don't sweat it
Give it back to you
Overkill
Overkill
Overkill
Get on it!&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Hey babe don't act so scared
All I want is some special care
On the run from some institution
All I want is some constellation

And I can tell by his face
I'm a total disgrace
Put me inside this place
Move over for a damage case

Hey baby wait a minute, stop
Don't run away, don't call a cop
I Ain't lookin' to victimize you
All I want to do is tantalize you

I can tell by your face
I'm all over this place
I can tell by your face
Got no time for a damage case

No time baby!

Hey babe don't turn away
I'm here tomorrow, gone today
I don't know what you think your game is
I don't care if you want your name is

And I can tell by this face
You're all over the place
I can tell by his face
Move over for a damage case
Get the fuck over man!

All right&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Get on!

You think you see me
In the glass
You think you hear me
Better listen fast
I think I see you
Gone to seed
Think your reason
Is your guilt and greed

You're out there on your own
Your face turned to stone
What ever happened to your life?
Stone dead forever
All right

You're a financial wizard
Yeah a top tycoon
You're Sweet long lizard
With a silver spoon
You know you've never had it
Quite so good
And you didn't know
That you even could

Your time has come to own
Your touch turned to gold
What ever happened to your life?
Stone dead forever
All right

Financial wizard
A top tycoon
Sweet lounge lizard
With a silver spoon
You've never had it
Quite so good
And you didn't know
That you even could

But your time has turned to gold
Your touch is turned to gold
What ever happened to your life?
Stone dead forever

It's been a long time
It's been a long long wait
And you caught your fingers
In the pearly gates
You better leave your number
And we'll call you
You know your problem
Ain't exactly new

Your time has come today
Your face has turned to hey
What ever happened to your life?
Stone dead forever
That's right

Yo

Ah&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Huh

I see that nothin's changed
Insist on playing games
Some waste of time you are
And you're so popular
Well this is it you bitch
I've got to make my switch
I'm just another john
I know what's goin' on

Your move
What do I have to lose?
Stalemate
No-oh, too late, too late

I thought you was for real
But you're a rip-off deal
Don't give me all that crap
I just escaped your trap
I think you see the joke
But you're just chasin' smoke
You ain't another one
I know what's goin' on

Your move
What do I have to lose?
Stalemate
Hello, too late, too late
Oh

Get on it!

Misunderstanding me
The way you feel so free
I'm gonna jump the gun
Oh I'm gonna hit an' run
Your credibility
Don't cut no ice with me
Another privelige gone
I know what's goin' on

Your move
What do I have to lose?
Stalemate
Oh oh, too late, too late
Oh, too late, too late&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;And it feels right this time
On this crash course we're in the big time
Pay no mind to the distant thunder
Beauty fills his head with wonder, boy. 

Says it feels right this time
Turn around, found new high lights
Good day to be alive Sir
Good day to be alive, he said

Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel
is just a freight train coming your way
Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel
is just the freight train coming your way

Don't it feel right like this
All the pieces fall to his wish
Suck up for that quick reward boy
Suck up for that quick reward they said

Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel
is just a freight train coming your way
Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel
is just the freight train coming your way
It's coming your way
It's coming your way
Here comes

Yeah, Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel
Is just a freight train coming your way. Yeah
Then it comes to be, Yeah(repeat 8 times)&lt;/lyrics&gt;

Touch me so I think I'm here
Skin my senses
Barely breathing
Minus Human
Please squeeze the world and drip it down my throat again
Down my throat again woooah

&lt;lyrics&gt;And now I wait my whole lifetime
For you
And now I wait my whole lifetime
For you

I ride the dirt I ride the tide
For you
I search the outside search inside
For you

To take back what you left me
YOU know I'll always burn to be
The one who seeks so I may find
And now I wait my whole lifetime

I'm Outlaw of torn
I'm Outlaw of torn
I'm Outlaw of torn
And I'm torn

So long I wait my whole lifetime
For you
So long I wait my whole lifetime
For you

The more I search the more my need
For you
The more I bless the more I bleed
For you

You make me smash the clock and feel
I'd rather die behind the wheel
Time was never on my side
So long I wait my whole lifetime


Outlaw of torn
Outlaw of torn
Outlaw of torn
And I'm torn

Hear me
And if I close my mind in fear
Please pry it open
See me
And if my face becomes sincere
Beware
Hold me
And when I start to come undone
Stitch me together
Save me
And when you see me strut
Remind me of what left this outlaw torn

Hear me
And if I close my mind in fear
Please pry it open
See me
And if my face becomes sincere
Beware
Hold me
And when I start to come undone
Stitch me together
Save me
And when you see me strut
Remind me of what left this outlaw torn&lt;/lyrics&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4917">I've begun work on a 'Lyriki Editor' so to speak.  I'm not sure what I'm going to write it in yet.  Considering that Mono is becoming more supported in the Linux world, I've been heavily considering C#.   It's just faster and seems easier to write, but, considering that I'd be learning the language as writing it, and there's not the same amount of resources available for C#, it's still only a consideration.

I've also considered writing it in Java.  The main reason for those two languages as choice is just the want to make it a simple binary program that's easily portable.  Whilst perl is good and all for me dinking with it, it's been brought up that most people don't have all the needed perl modules installed, and less computer literate users might have real trouble with that.

Intended features for Lyriki Editor

* Automatic proper formatting of Lyric pages based upon the data given.  It will attempt to generate as many pages as it can that do not already exist.  IE: If given Artist, Album, Year, AlbumArt, SongTitle, and Lyrics.  It will create all 3 related pages should none of them exist.  If the Artist page already exists, it will make an attempt to understand what's posted there, and append discography info, so on and so forth.  The idea is to make it as easy as possible to get the data onto Lyriki.
* Clear Prompting, Right now, there's not really a very clear idea of what to do to add pages and what information you need.  With the Lyriki Editor, it'll have fields for all required data, and should it need information you haven't entered in order to generate a page, it will ask you to fill in the proper field.
* Lyriki Browser, able to retrieve and view any information on Lyriki, allowing for editing and re-submission.

Actual work accomplished?  Nil ;).  Still been fighting over the decision of what to use, and either way.  My coding abilities are amatuerish at best.  But, feel free to suggest features you'd like to see, etc.

--[[User:Nanenj|Nanenj]] 17:26, 11 January 2006 (PST)

The following is a perl script application I've been working with to remotely retrieve lyrics from Lyriki. 

If there's any other developers that wish to release open source code to work with Lyriki, please feel free.  Myself in particular am fond of win32 compatible scripting languages such as Perl, Ruby, and Python.  Extremely quick and easy to work with, and no complex compilers to mess with.  But, of course any contribution as long as the source code is attached is more then welcome.

&lt;lyrics&gt;Two men
Started walking
Started talking of better days
One says to the other
We do it all again
Seems I knew I would

And now I found it
Found that I got it
I didn't want this
Somebody help me see
And now I feel it
Feel that I've been there
I didn't need this
Will somebody help me breathe?

Here we are again
Just face to facing
Each other another day
Who wins
Well who cares
It always ends up the same
Seems I knew I would

And now I found it
Found that I got it
I didn't want this
Somebody help me see
And now I feel it
Feel that I've been there
I didn't need this
Will somebody help me stand?
And now I've told them
Already warned them
I didn't want this
Somebody help me breathe

If I was them
Then I wanna be what I see
If I could drag my life in a moment
Wanna know, do you want me to go
Gonna keep it all from ending
Never stop myself from pretending
That you always knew that I never could

All I ever really wanted was to be the same
Equal treatment never ever comes
There they go again
All I ever really wanted was to be like you
So perfect
So worthless
If I could take it all back, think again
I would

And now I found it
Found that I got it
I didn't want this
Somebody help me see
And now I feel it
Feel that I've been there
I didn't need this
Will somebody help me stand?
And now I've told them
I didn't want this
I didn't need this
Would somebody help me breathe?
Would somebody help me breathe?
Will somebody help me?&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;Who made up all the rules?
We follow them like fools,
Believe them to be true,
Don't care to think them through.

I'm sorry, so sorry.
I'm sorry it's like this.
I'm sorry, so sorry.
I'm sorry we do this.

And it's ironic too,
'Cause what we tend to do
Is act on what they say
And then it is that way.

I'm sorry, so sorry.
I'm sorry it's like this.
I'm sorry, so sorry.
I'm sorry we do this.

Who are they?
Where are they?
How can they possibly
Know all this?
Who are they?
Where are they?
How can they possibly
Know all this?

Do you see what I see?
Why do we live like this?
Is it because it's true
That ignorance is bliss?

Who are they?
Where are they?
How do they
Know all this?
I'm sorry, so sorry.
I'm sorry it's like this.

Do you see what I see?
Why do we live like this?
Is it because it's true
That ignorance is bliss?

Who are they?
Where are they?
How can they
Know all this?
I'm sorry, so sorry.
I'm sorry it's like this.&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;
Never made it as a wise man
I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealing
Tired of living like a blind man
I'm sick of sight without a sense of feeling

And this is how you remind me
This is how you remind me
Of what I really am
This is how you remind me
Of what I really am

It's not like you to say sorry
I was waiting on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breaking
And I've been wrong, I've been down,
Been to the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream &quot;are we having fun yet?&quot;

It's not like you didn't know that
I said I love you and I swear I still do
And it must have been so bad
Cause living with me must have damn near killed you

And this is how you remind me
Of what I really am
This is how you remind me
Of what I really am

It's not like you to say sorry
I was waiting on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breaking
And I've been wrong, I've been down,
Been to the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream &quot;are we having fun yet?&quot;

Never made it as a wise man
I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealing
And this is how you remind me
This is how you remind me
This is how you remind me
Of what I really am
This is how you remind me
Of what I really am

It's not like you to say sorry
I was waiting on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breaking
And I've been wrong, I've been down
Been to the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream &quot;are we having fun yet?&quot;

Are we having fun yet?
Are we having fun yet?
Are we having fun yet?
&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;I like your pants around your feet
I like the dirt that's on your knees
And I like the way you still say please
While you're looking up at me
You're like my favourite damn disease

And I love the places that we go
And I love the people that you know
And I love the way you can't say no
Too many long lines in a row
I love the powder on your nose

And now I know who you are
It wasn't that hard
Just to figure you out
And now I know who you are
It wasn't that hard
Just to figure you out

I like the freckles on your chest
And I like the way you like me best
And I like the way you're not impressed,
While you put me to the test
I like the white stains on your dress

And I love the way you pass the check
And I love the good times that you wreck
And I love your lack of self-respect
While you're passed out on the deck
I love my hands around your neck

And now I know who you are
It wasn't that hard
Just to figure you out
And now I know who you are
It wasn't that hard
Just to figure you out

I like your pants around your feet
And I like the dirt that's on your knees
And I like the way you still say please
While you're looking up at me
You're like my favorite damn disease

And I hate the places that we go
And I hate the people that you know
And I hate the way you can't say no
Too many long lines in a row
I hate the powder on your nose

And now I know who you are
It wasn't that hard
Just to figure you out
And now I know who you are
It wasn't that hard
Just to figure you out&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;
Beautiful dawn - lights up the shore for me.
There is nothing else in the world,
I'd rather wake up and see (with you).
Beautiful dawn - I'm just chasing time again.
Thought I would die a lonely man, in endless night.
But now I'm high; running wild among all the stars above.
Sometimes it's hard to believe you remember me.

Beautiful dawn - melt with the stars again.
Do you remember the day when my journey began?
Will you remember the end (of time)?
Beautiful dawn - You're just blowing my mind again.
Thought I was born to endless night, until you shine.
High; running wild among all the stars above.
Sometimes it's hard to believe you remember me.

Will you be my shoulder when I'm grey and older?
Promise me tomorrow starts with you,
Getting high; running wild among all the stars above.
Sometimes it's hard to believe you remember me
&lt;/lyrics&gt;

&lt;lyrics&gt;How the hell'd we wind up like this
And why weren't we able
To see the signs that we missed
And try to turn the tables
I wish you'd unclench your fists
And unpack your suitcase
Lately there's been too much of this
But don't think it's too late

Nothing's wrong
Just as long as you know that someday I will

Someday, somehow
I'm gonna make it alright
But not right now
I know you're wondering when
You're the only one who knows that

Someday, somehow
I'm gonna make it alright
But not right now
I know you're wondering when

Well I'd hope that since we're here anyway
That we could end up saying
Things we've always needed to say
So we could end up staying
Now the story's played out like this
Just like a paperback novel
Let's rewrite an ending that fits
Instead of a Hollywood horror

Nothing's wrong
Just as long as you know that someday I will

Someday, somehow
I'm gonna make it alright
But not right now
I know you're wondering when
You're the only one who knows that

Someday, somehow
I'm gonna make it alright
But not right now
I know you're wondering when
You're the only one who knows that

How the hell'd we wind up like this
And why weren't we able
To see the signs that we missed
And try to turn the tables
Now the story's played out like this
Just like a paperback novel
Let's rewrite an ending that fits
Instead of a Hollywood horror

Nothing's wrong
Just as long as you know that someday I will

Someday, somehow
I'm gonna make it alright
But not right now
I know you're wondering when
You're the only one who knows that

Someday, somehow
I'm gonna make it alright
But not right now
I know you're wondering when
You're the only one who knows that
I know you're wondering when
You're the only one who knows that
I know you're wondering when&lt;/lyrics&gt;
