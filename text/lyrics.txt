Something I'm missing, since the new song link code was added to the adding new albums.  I know it's been in a while now, but it just hit me today...Previously, when there was a song that used the pound (#) symbol, I would link to [[Artist:Number 4|#4]] for example.  But, with the new &lt;pre&gt;# {{song link|Artist|Song}}&lt;/pre&gt; stuff, I don't think this is possible anymore...or is it?  I ran into this on [[Dave Matthews Band:Crash (1996)]], where track 5 is [[Dave Matthews Band:#41]], but due to wiki/html limitations, it must be written out like [[Dave Matthews Band:Number 41]], but on the Album page, I'd like the link to that song to show up as it does on the cd cover, #44 - is there any work around? --ahoier 04:48, 3 January 2007 (PST)

Now, seriously... I didn't started changing pages before (help pages) because I think rules defining the &quot;official&quot; way of doing things should, at least, go through some minimal discussion first, specially when they affect so many pages in a non reversible way. When we change a template without affecting the way everybody uses it, then it's no big deal, it can be easily reverted if needed, but when we tell people how to write album pages (there are almost 2000 of those) we better get it right from start or we'll end up with a mess the size of LyricWiki...

Let me say this: '''unnamed parameters suck'''. They may be convenient in some situations but they easily become a mess.

'''1st)''' They don't trim empty spaces so if someone writes '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{song link|Mark Lanegan| Museum|2:50}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' ({{song link|Mark Lanegan| Museum|2:50}}) the link will point to an unexisting page even though the page [[Mark Lanegan:Museum|exists]]. The example artificially introduces an error, however there are valid cases when this wouldn't be considered as such. For example, it's not possible to use this template like we do with other ones

'''2nd)''' They don't scale well (actually, they don't scale at all...) when you need to add additional parameters or when you can't know in advance how many parameters the template will receive (''Note'': the original version of the template accepted various artists).
2nd They dont scale well actually they dont scale at all when you need to add additional parameters or when you cant know in advance how many parameters the template will receive Note the original version of the template accepted various artists


'''3rd)''' They force you to &quot;provide&quot; all unnamed parameters, even if you don't want to. To provide the &quot;'''info''' parameter&quot; you must provide the length even if it's irrelevant or unknown (you can leave it blank of course). Song links can be placed in many places, not just album pages. In some contexts it would be desirable to omit things such as the track length (think for example an artist page mentioning a single and linking to that song). Also note how since the template introduction a few days ago (a week?) already another parameter ('''disp''') had to be added: named and thus optional. If it weren't named, not only '''length''' but also '''info''' should be left blank to provide it (well... there is other way, but it's hard enough to assume it won't be used). This inconvenient only gets bigger as more parameters are needed.

I may seem as if I'm pushing it with this template, that it doesn't require so many parameters, but it's already on the edge and there's another template, [[Template:va_song_link|va song link]], with a related function (meant to be used on [[(Various Artists)|Various Artists]] records) which can't get away with using unnamed parameters. Given that it would be very convenient to use both templates the same way (since it would make things easier for users), it's also another reason not to use unnamed parameters in either template.

:3) Not exactly true, if someone accidentally put the info in the length parameter, probably no one would notice until someone tried to add the length.  I suppose '''length''' and '''info''' could become named parameters, but this would start to defeat the purpose of the template.  '''disp''' was simply an oversight on my part (which need not be used often, as I noted above).  What other parameters would &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;song link}} need?  I can't think of an instance (aside from various artist links) which cannot be handled by &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;song link}} as it is now.

::1) We agree on this. I pointed this out for 2 reasons: first, though it's possible to correct this, it's not done in the current implementation; second, though possible, it's an ugly hack that would probably result in processing overhead on the server. I really don't know how wikimedia software handles templates, so we could be dealing with a negligible overhead or a big (and unnecessary) one. The trade of between it's convenience and the overhead it brings should be considered when thinking on applying this solution.

::It's also true that currently it's unlikely to write a &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;song link}} multi-line. however, that's also dependent on the complexity of the template: if the template were to gain more parameters it may not be completely ridiculous anymore.

::2) It means that you start to realize how much unnamed parameters suck when you need to add more parameters to the template: then their &quot;logical order&quot; starts loosing sense. Same happens when there are optional parameters. Though I agree now that '''disp''' is mostly unnecessary (read at the end), same can be told about '''info''' and '''length''' or other (now inexistent) optional parameters. If &quot;logical order&quot; is already questionable with mandatory arguments, it just makes no sense when applied to optional arguments.

::You also missed the point of having both '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;song link}}''' and '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;va song link}}''' use the same parameters. Ease of use it's not the only reason for having both be used the same way. Specifying various artists separately has one ''potential'' advantage: it provides more info for the template to work with. For instance, '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;song link}}''' could use this information to build automatically (and correctly) the song artist. Say I want to make a link to &quot;John Parish And Polly Jean Harvey:Girl&quot;, if I provide to the template &quot;John Parish&quot; and &quot;Polly Jean Harvey&quot; separately (instead of only &quot;John Parish And Polly Jean Harvey&quot;) the template can be trusted to build the link with the correct (&quot;official&quot;) connector (whether it is '&amp;', 'and', 'And' or whatever).

::For the record, I also like the idea of short song links, that's why I was using mostly one letter names: '''a''' (artist, optionally followed by a number for multiple artists), '''s''' (song), '''l''' (length), '''c''' (comment -now '''info''').

::3) There's a problem with your reasoning. You're making assumptions on how people will use the template based on it's current implementation. The only reason why people wouldn't note what you point out it's because, currently (and by chance), '''length''' and '''info''' parameters are displayed exactly the same way (both with small font and between brackets, but I remember not long ago the recommended way was to have the length without brackets). A more likely outcome is that people will start using this 2 fields interchangeably (without noticing it or simply because they like the inverted order better) and it will be impossible to change those parameters' style latter without breaking existing pages. '''The implementation ''must'' be independent of the interface and vice versa'''.

::I do however rescue something from what your wrote that I think it's a really good idea (now I seriously wonder why I never think of that before :) ). Until now I was convinced that the only way of handling the capitalization/search problem was to create pages with all words capitalized, optionally creating redirects with the correct capitalization (anyone can verify that '''I've moved tons of pages''' for the sake of that...)

:::As far as the '''length''' and the new formatting as a whole, what was the purpose of it?  I know when I first got here, I had a little time grasphing the whole capitalization stuff, since I'm used to musicbrainz capitalization rules, but after having it explained; it all made sense to have every first letter of every word capitalized, due to wiki search methods.  But yea from what I saw, the old # [[Artist:Track...]] etc worked fine before, using '''small''' code for the time, and ''Italic text'' or whatever to note a bonus track, (equivalent to the new '''info''' parameter?), etc.  But yea, I could probably go along with the whole thing of having redirects point to the '''P'''roperly '''C'''apitalized '''T'''itle '''O'''f '''A''' '''S'''ong.  --ahoier 05:22, 7 January 2007 (PST)

::::'''@ahoier''': using templates has advantages over writing the link directly: first, it allows us to automatically change the style for all links created with it by simply changing the template code; second, it makes it easier to write them since you don't have to write the formatting yourself and you don't have to enter information repeatedly (if you do it manually you have to write the song title twice).

::::'''@MindlessXD''': I generally agree that we could create a new template if we want to add fancy stuff, but that's not what I'm talking about. When I said that '''disp''' was mostly unnecessary I didn't mean it could be taken out of the template. Changing the way we capitalize letters it's not going to help with cases such as [[Dave_Matthews_Band:Number_41|the Dave Matthews Band song that started this discussion]]. You still need a way to handle those cases where the limitation comes from the wiki itself. Now, '''disp''' does the trick for the song title but what about the artist? Is there any reason to believe this can't happen with the artist too? Obviously not. We would need to add another parameter to handle this case. Can you see where I'm going? ''You don't need to be doing unnecessarily complex things to found yourself dealing with many parameters''. The result is this: there is only 2 parameters that could be left unnamed: '''artist''' and '''title''' ('''length''' does not make the cut as it's optional).

::::Now, perhaps you can explain me why you think having to specify the artist as '''a=''' and the title as '''t=''' (that's 4 more letters) is such a big burden. Consider what you allow by having the artist be a named parameter: you can handle multiple artist separately (again, specifying multiple artist separately is better that doing it all as one!). I've already mentioned some reasons why I thinks this is a good idea (such as having the template correctly link the artists), now consider the possibility of one of the multiple artist having a # (or some other invalid character) in it's name: instead of rewriting all the artists you can just specify how to display that particular artist. An unlikely scenario, I know, but what's the cost of having this? Almost none.
