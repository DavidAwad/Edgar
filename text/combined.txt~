This encounter is a miracle.
Never forget, this moment is ours.
It’s strange, This feeling I have right now.
It’s almost as if it came falling down from the sky.
The color of this special season excites my heart.
From the first time we met,
The melody of my heart has shouted a sign.
I can’t stop, I won’t stop, Why?
Reach!
Shall I name this heartrending pain “Snow halation?”
I can’t wait for thoughts pile up,
It’s vexing but it’s a pure-hearted devotion called love.
Even amidst a slight fever I can’t hesitate.
Accepting the courage to dive in, I’ll soon Start!!
Without a sound, Without an indication,
Fate changes silently.
My heartbeat quickens to the future starting now.
When you feel worried for instance,
I’ll come running right away wanting to hug you tightly,
Wherever you are, No matter where, Fly high!
Hurry up!
Before I knew it, my “True emotion” had grown so large.
It’s painful only seeing it as a dream!
The one I want to call my lover is you.
I can’t be bewildered by your gentle eyes!
Take all my affection as it is all at once, Please!!
Reach!

I feel like our meeting changed me.
I found the person I want to be.
The thing I longed for.
Was growing inside my heart the whole time
Everyone was jumping a giant jump rope.
But I was too scared to join.
I was hesitant, like a child.
Always waiting for you.
You reached out to me when I gave up.
I loved the warmth of your gentle hand.
I’m overflowing with “thank you”s for you.
Little by little I’m getting closer to my dream.
I’m overflowing with “thank you”s for you.
Thank you.
I’m so happy, so happy, so beyond happy,
That I’m crying… sorry.
If I say goodbye to my hesitant feelings.
Instead of being lost for words and hanging my head.
I always, always long to see you.
I can’t let it end inside my heart.
I jumped rope with everyone so many times.
And even smiled a bunch myself.
I want us to be together while playing.
That feeling is precious to me.
When I was lost along the road, you taught me.
Your gentle eyes told me my dream would come true.
This heart-pounding feeling won’t disappear when I say thank you.
I’ll grasp my dream little by little.
This heart-pounding feeling won’t disappear when I say thank you…
Thank you.
It’s so much fun, it’s so much fun, when I tried to hold you.
I cried… sorry.
I’m overflowing with “thank you”s for you
Little by little I’m getting closer to my dream
I’m overflowing with “thank you”s for you…
Thank you.
I’m so happy, so happy, so beyond happy,
That I’m crying… sorry.
