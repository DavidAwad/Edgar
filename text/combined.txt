I found the person I want to be.
The thing I longed for.
Was growing inside my heart the whole time
Everyone was jumping a giant jump rope.
But I was too scared to join.
I was hesitant, like a child.
Always waiting for you.
You reached out to me when I gave up.
I loved the warmth of your gentle hand.
I’m overflowing with thank you for you.
Little by little I’m getting closer to my dream.
I’m overflowing with thank you for you.
Thank you.
I’m so happy, so happy, so beyond happy,

If I say goodbye to my hesitant feelings.
Instead of being lost for words and hanging my head.
I always, always long to see you.
I can’t let it end inside my heart.
I jumped rope with everyone so many times.
And even smiled a bunch myself.
I want us to be together while playing.
That feeling is precious to me.
When I was lost along the road, you taught me.
Your gentle eyes told me my dream would come true.
This heart-pounding feeling won’t disappear when I say thank you.
I’ll grasp my dream little by little.
This heart-pounding feeling won’t disappear when I say thank you…
Thank you.
It’s so much fun, it’s so much fun, when I tried to hold you.
I cried sorry.
