I whisper 
gentle words
I'm not just 
pretending to be cute
I have to coldly
strongly 
protect 
those precious to me
and those weak
Who am I, yes
You've grown curious, yes.
Then it might just 
be love
Knowing secrets 
lie hidden in my heart
what will you do about that
It's soldier game
Will you ask about them 
next time we meet
