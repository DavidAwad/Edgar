Training Data was scraped off of azlyrics for convenience.

still more to go Let’s go

 My aim is that beautiful
 far-off rainbow
 so It's time to time
 The trunks sway in the wind
 We’ll go together
 Nurture everyone’s tree of dreams are strong
 Now
 Cheers for the farewell parade
 Jump into the distance
 I wonder if it’ll be fine if we sing
 Pure feelings of excitement
 Point to the future
 What was the most important thing
 What was the most important thing
 What was it
 A small effort will bring forth tomorrow Let's strike while loving the moment
 With that sort of energy
 let's do our best so wave goodbye to my dream
 I’m overflowing with thank you for you… Thank you
 I’m so happy
 so happy
 so beyond That
```
